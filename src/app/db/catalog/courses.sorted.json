        "details": "The emphasis will be on the design of the transmitter and receiver sections of a wireless system, but antenna design will also be covered to provide an understanding of the techniques used to achieve directional and steerable antennas when appropriate for the given wireless system. The wide range of carrier frequencies seen in wireless systems leads to a variety of semiconductor and other technologies being required at different carrier frequencies. In addition, the bandwidth of the signal leads to substantially different issues arising in the packaging used for the transmitter and receiver ends. For lower carrier frequencies, advanced silicon IC technologies are preferred, given the maturity of the technology and the considerable density of both analog and digital circuitry that can be integrated on a single IC. At higher frequencies, the limits of contemporary silicon technologies are encountered, leading to use of specialized semiconductor technologies such as GaAs and SiGe circuits. In addition, the difficulty of realizing high accuracy analog/digital conversions at multi-GHz frequencies leads to a preference, at this time, for analog for analog circuitry at the higher frequencies. On the other hand, analog/digital conversions are becoming possible at sufficiently high sampling rates that digital processing is being strongly pursued directly at the front end of a receiver, allowing a variety of new techniques to be considered for the overall receiver design. In cases where front-end digital signal processing cannot be achieved, such digital processing is increasingly used at intermediate frequencies (i.e., the IF section). In the case of data communications, digital techniques are almost certainly used at baseband, for example to separate the data signal from the received analog signal, to perform data decoding, etc. The course will include material related to contemporary digital signal processor technologies, supplementing the discussions in Course 2 by considering in greater depth the physical design and performance limitations of technologies and architectures.",

Architecture and design principles which enable resilient and innovative response are illuminated and then applied in synthesis exercises. Hands-on, minds-on exercises prepare and guide the participant in applying the knowledge. Systems for case study and focus can run the range from products and processes to governance and infrastructure to enterprises and systems-of-systems.",

        "details": "This course presents a systems architecting process to achieve enterprise integration both within and between corporate boundaries. The process leverages systems thinking - the antithesis of scientific reductionism, which fails to appreciate the interrelationships between components that make-up a system. Systems thinking has proven to be successful in the delivery of integrated technology products, and is now being applied to understanding the structure and dynamics of organizations for which communications and co-stuff in general is a key to business success; in other words inter-relationships are prime in managing an enterprise. The systems approach further emphasizes emergence, wider systems and the environment. These concepts are crucial to architecting an enterprise in consideration of issues of decentralization, alliance advantage, and market phenomena. Prerequisites: SDOE 675",

        "details": "The frontier of systems engineering today seeks new levels of system capability and behavior, and expects to find that benefit in higher forms of systems that elude traditional control and creation concepts. Common themes converge here in a study of agility across a seemingly wide variety of interesting system types, characterized principally by aspects of self-organization and systems of systems. Esthetic quality in systems and enterprises makes the difference between enforced compliance and embraced experience; and determines the positive or negative vectors of self-organization and emergence. This module explores the value and nature of esthetic design quality, principles and architectures for harnessing self organized systems of systems, agility as risk management and reality confrontation, and similar issues at the edge of agile system and enterprise knowledge.

This approach is made possible by emphasizing the simultaneity of perspectives, the role of paradox, and the centrality of soft issues in resolving complexity.

By considering these questions through the vehicle of fiction, literature elicits not only the audience or readers\u2019 intellect, but their emotions as well \u2013 in both cases, by means of reader-response. One pressing question we will tackle is whether fiction that engages issues of power and politics does \u2013 or can function to \u2013 change the world.",

Organized as a historical survey of technology and the arts, the course will move beyond the idea of the arts as simple modes of expression to consider how it has been an active site of cultural practice. The course will begin with the concept of \u201ctechne,\u201d first used in antiquity, as a means of establishing the philosophical basis of creative practice and showing the fundamental unity between art, science and technology. Through weekly lectures, readings, and discussion, we will explore the many ways that science and technology informs and inspires the creative production.

The course aims to guide and strengthen students in developing the skills of active listening in order to increase their enjoyment of ballet music, film music, music theater and opera. To this end, the course strengthens the students\u2019 ability to identify and respond to the basic conventions of ballet, film, music theater and opera and the way that the basic musical building blocks - melody, harmony, rhythm, tempo, tone color and form - take creative advantage of these conventions for expressive purposes, including the creation of mood, characterization, narration and storytelling. The course is not intended as a historical survey of the genres of ballet, film music, music theater or opera. Rather, it focuses on important core works from these genres, placed in their historical and stylistic context for purposes of comparison and appreciation. The aim throughout is to focus on works that an interested music lover is liable to hear in the normal course of their musical experience and that form a basis for further in-depth exploration of these genres. At the same time, the course provides, without losing this central focus, at least brief exposure and consideration of selected examples of contemporary pop and commercial music in these and related genres, including hip-hop and music video, that will build on the students\u2019 pre-existing interest and enthusiasm. Finally, and unique to the Music and Technology program at Stevens, the course draws special attention, wherever appropriate, to important milestones in the development of music technology and their impact on the development of music in the genres of ballet, film music, music theater and opera as well as related contemporary genres.\u2002 Prerequisites: None.
