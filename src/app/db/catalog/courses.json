Structures that express this behavior clearly and elegantly achieve the highest levels of artistic creation, and become cultural symbols that exceed historical and cultural boundaries. This course explores Art in Structural Engineering as it evolves in modern history, beginning with the Cast Iron bridges of the Industrial Revolution. It progresses through the works of Eiffel, Roebling, Freyssinet, and Maillart to modern day innovators like Menn, Khan, and Calatrava. Students learn engineering concepts through technical presentations on structural landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Guggenheim Museum, George Washington Bridge, and the Hearst Tower. The course studies beautiful works of structural art and takes site visits in the metropolitan area to supplement the classroom material. These trips will include the Brooklyn Bridge, Skyscraper Museum, Cast Iron District, Flatiron Building, Guggenheim Museum, and Hearst Building. The course converges engineering, architecture, design, and art into one distinguished field. It teaches the concepts and designs behind structural engineering, so high a quality in imaginative conception and execution, that the engineering itself takes on the aspects of art.

    "details": "Water is probably the most used, the most abused, and the most taken for granted natural resource. Few people realize what is involved in the planning and building of urban water-distribution and management systems. Environmental costs must also be considered when analyzing any water resources project. Efforts continue toward conservation and environmental protection, which increases the need for engineers to be educated in the behavior of water as it moves through the water cycle. This course will address the modern day hydrologic processes, the mathematical and scientific processes for hydrology and introduce several models commonly used in industry. These models will aid the engineer in analyzing the hydrologic processes of a particular region and help provide the best solution for a very sensitive issue.",

    "details": "The emphasis will be on the design of the transmitter and receiver sections of a wireless system, but antenna design will also be covered to provide an understanding of the techniques used to achieve directional and steerable antennas when appropriate for the given wireless system. The wide range of carrier frequencies seen in wireless systems leads to a variety of semiconductor and other technologies being required at different carrier frequencies. In addition, the bandwidth of the signal leads to substantially different issues arising in the packaging used for the transmitter and receiver ends. For lower carrier frequencies, advanced silicon IC technologies are preferred, given the maturity of the technology and the considerable density of both analog and digital circuitry that can be integrated on a single IC. At higher frequencies, the limits of contemporary silicon technologies are encountered, leading to use of specialized semiconductor technologies such as GaAs and SiGe circuits. In addition, the difficulty of realizing high accuracy analog/digital conversions at multi-GHz frequencies leads to a preference, at this time, for analog for analog circuitry at the higher frequencies. On the other hand, analog/digital conversions are becoming possible at sufficiently high sampling rates that digital processing is being strongly pursued directly at the front end of a receiver, allowing a variety of new techniques to be considered for the overall receiver design. In cases where front-end digital signal processing cannot be achieved, such digital processing is increasingly used at intermediate frequencies (i.e., the IF section). In the case of data communications, digital techniques are almost certainly used at baseband, for example to separate the data signal from the received analog signal, to perform data decoding, etc. The course will include material related to contemporary digital signal processor technologies, supplementing the discussions in Course 2 by considering in greater depth the physical design and performance limitations of technologies and architectures.",

The course is not intended as a historical survey of the genres of ballet, film music, music theater or opera. Rather, it focuses on important core works from these genres, placed in their historical and stylistic context for purposes of comparison and appreciation. The aim throughout is to focus on works that an interested music lover is liable to hear in the normal course of their musical experience and that form a basis for further in-depth exploration of these genres.
