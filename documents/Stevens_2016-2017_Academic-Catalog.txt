ABOUT
The Academic Catalog is a resource designed to help students prepare for and plan their studies. The Academic Catalog
contains information about undergraduate and graduate education including information about each degree and program
offered and the requirements and curricula for earning each degree. It also contains information on academic procedures
and requirements, financial aid, student life, student services and university policies.
It is the personal responsibility of each student to acquire an active knowledge of all pertinent information set forth in the
Academic Catalog.
The policies and requirements listed in the Catalog are in effect for the entirety of the listed academic year. The edition of
the Catalog that contains a student’s degree and graduation requirements is determined by their academic year of entry or
reentry and academic year of acceptance to their major or program. Archived catalogs are available online or by contacting
the Office of the Registrar.
Stevens Institute of Technology reserves the right to change the information, regulations, requirements, procedures and
policies announced in this catalog including but not limited to: requirements for admission; graduation or degrees; scheduling;
credit or content of courses; fees; and calendars.

OUR HISTORY & MISSION
Founded in 1870 by “America’s First Family of Inventors,” the Stevens family, Stevens Institute of Technology is a premier
technological research university with a legacy of leadership in fields including engineering, finance, cybersecurity and
coastal resilience.
Stevens graduates co-founded both General Motors and Texas Instruments, engineered the world’s first urban power plant,
engineered and erected the steel frames of New York City’s Empire State Building and Chrysler Building, and directed the
design and preparation of spacecraft modules for NASA’s Apollo moon launch missions. From Frederick Winslow Taylor, the
father of scientific management, and Mark Crispin (inventor of the IMAP email protocol), to Nobel Prize-winning physicist
Frederick Reines (discoverer of the neutrino, confirming the ‘big bang’ theory), artist Alexander Calder (inventor of the
hanging art form known as the mobile), award-winning journalist and political commentator Richard Reeves and cloudsoftware pioneer Gregory Gianforte, Stevens has produced a long line of technical and business leaders, innovators and
entrepreneurs.
Stevens laboratories and facilities continue to enable groundbreaking research. The Davidson Laboratory features the fastest
wave tank complex located at a U.S. university and has played a role in virtually every major maritime and coastal engineering
advance of the past century and a half, including the development of modern submarines and the re-engineering of Apollo
space capsules. The Hanlon Financial Systems Lab features a state-of-the-art simulated Wall Street trading room complete
with Bloomberg terminals streaming real-time market data and a full suite of leading-edge software tools for financial
analysis. The Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC), a Stevens-led consortium of approximately twenty institutions,
is supported by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), producing important insights in the creation and evolution of complex
systems and the development of systems engineers. The Immersion Lab enables high-definition visualization of complex
concepts and data for professional audiences and non-professional audiences and stakeholders. Stevens is home to three
National Centers for Excellence, research facilities selected by the U.S. government to lead national research, development
and education efforts to address critical global needs including port security, ship design and development and systems
engineering.
The Stevens mission is clear:

To inspire, nurture and educate leaders in tomorrow’s technology-centric environment while
contributing to the solution of the most challenging problems of our time.

OUR HISTORY & MISSION
We believe that the solutions to many of the critical problems that face humanity can be found in the improved use and
understanding of technology, and that it is our duty to produce engineers, scientists and business leaders prepared for this
challenge. This vision is embodied in our Stevens curriculum, which uniquely blends hands-on innovation, entrepreneurship
and marketing education with engineering and technical training with the goal of helping students learn to think outside
of the box and develop real-world products, services, applications and intellectual property. Stevens’ small size and multidisciplinary environment provides students and researchers alike the opportunity to continually collaborate in projects that
cut across departmental lines.
Our vision — outlined in our strategic plan, “The Future. Ours to Create.” — is to become a premier, student-centric
technological research university.
We will achieve this goal through five key strategic priorities:
Student-Centricity. Stevens will place an extraordinary emphasis on the development of its students, their
academic and leadership development, career preparation and personal growth.
Excellence in All We Do. Stevens will maintain an unrelenting commitment to excellence in all that it does.
Through Collaboration, Impact. Building on our agility and collaborative spirit, Stevens will break down internal
barriers to collaborative education and research to maximize the impact of the work of our faculty and students.
Technology at Our Core. Proud of our legacy, we will embrace the power of technology as a differentiator to offer
a distinctive educational experience to our students, drive our research and scholarship programs, devise novel
teaching and learning methods and enhance our administrative, outreach and communication activities.
Strengthened Reputation, Increased Prestige. Stevens alumni, faculty and research have made a significant
positive impact on the world for more than 140 years. We will continue to ensure that our graduates continue to
play a critical role in solving the technology-based problems of the future.
Stevens will directly address key areas of societal and global interest including healthcare and medicine, STEM (science,
technology, engineering and mathematics) education, finance, coastal resilience and systems engineering through a
comprehensive research program and new course and degree offerings.
As we move forward into the future together — a future that will be defined by the nation’s and the world’s appropriate and
ethical use of technology for societal benefit — Stevens will continue to be at the forefront of discovery and innovation, and
we will continue to train designers, inventors, managers and leaders for this exciting new era.

STUDENT SERVICES
Career Fairs
The Career Center hosts three career fairs annually. Career fairs serve as an information exchange between students and
corporate representatives. The Fall Career Fair is targeted to graduating students. The Winter and Spring Career Fairs are
open to all Stevens students and provide access to full time employment and summer internship opportunities.

Summer Internships and the Full Time Employment Job Search
Internship experience is an integral part of the student career development process that supports attainment of successful
post-graduation career outcomes. The Career Center facilitates student access to summer internship opportunities. Students
participate by attending an orientation workshop and meeting with a career advisor who will assist in resume creation and
the internship search process. Students are encouraged to start their full time job search one year prior to graduation.
Programming is provided on how to conduct a job search and interact with employer representatives. Success is best
achieved through participation in the services offered by the Stevens Career Center.

Cooperative Education
Cooperative Education (Co-op) is a five-year educational program where students alternate between semesters of full time
study and full time work in areas related to their academic studies and career interests. The Co-op Program assists students
in clarifying their career aspirations while experiencing the connection between the theories learned in the classroom and
applied in the workplace.
A student’s first year is dedicated to completing freshman year academic requirements and attending Co-op meetings to
understand the rotational nature of the program, to prepare for the recruitment process, and to gain an understanding of
workplace expectations. Over the course of the second through fourth years, Co-op students alternate semesters of study
with semesters of full time employment in accordance with the Co-op study plan that has been approved by their Co-op
advisor. Senior year is devoted to full time study and completing the course requirements of the undergraduate degree.
The many benefits of participating in cooperative education include having the opportunity to work at a maximum of three
different employers and the ability to gain knowledge and skills while receiving compensation on a full-time basis when on
assignment.

Eligibility
The Co-op Program is available for full time undergraduate students pursuing degrees in the engineering or science disciplines.
Students must commit to following a five-year alternating work/study plan and attend the required Career Development
workshops. All freshman year course requirements must be completed and students must be in good academic standing
with a minimum 2.20 GPA. For more information, contact coop@stevens.edu, or 201.216.5166, or visit the Career Center
on the 6th Floor of the Wesley J. Howe Center.

UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION

Applying for Admissions
Admission to Stevens is a process designed to ensure that you have an accurate picture of the opportunities and challenges
offered by a Stevens education, and that the Admissions Committee has enough information to assess your potential for
success. With these goals in mind, several measures are used in making Admissions decisions.

High School Transcript
The most important criterion in our decision to admit you as a freshman is your academic performance in high school. (If
you are already studying at the college level and wish to apply for admission to transfer to Stevens, you must have earned at
least 30 college credits and submit an official copy of all college transcripts.) We believe that the quality of your recent work
is an accurate indication of your preparation for Stevens, thus your high school record should show strong performance in
the following areas:
For Engineering, Computer Science, Applied Sciences and Quantitative Finance: Four years of English; four years
of mathematics (one year of algebra; one year of geometry; one year of pre-calculus; and one year of calculus);
three years of science (biology, chemistry, and physics).
For Business and Science, Technology & Society: Four years of English; four years of mathematics (two years
of algebra; one year of geometry; and one year of pre-calculus); three years of science (biology, chemistry and
physics).
For Humanities: Four years of English; three years of mathematics (two years of algebra and one year of geometry);
one year of science – either physics, chemistry or biology. These are minimum requirements. Student planning
secondary concentrations in math or science should have more extensive preparation in these fields than
indicated above.
For Accelerated Pre-Medicine Program: Four years of English; four years of college prep mathematics; three years
of science (biology, chemistry, and physics). Students are encouraged to pursue AP Biology and AP Chemistry,
if possible. To be considered for the Accelerated Medicine Program, students must have a combined score of
at least 1400 on the SAT I (critical reading and mathematics sections), and have taken the two SAT Subject Test
(Math Level I or II and Biology or Chemistry). Students may take these tests in the junior or senior year. All tests
should be completed by October of the senior year so that we have time to evaluate scores.
Please have your guidance/college counselor submit an official copy of your transcript.

College Entrance Examinations
The College Entrance Examinations are a second and somewhat different test of your abilities. Stevens requires the Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SAT I) or the American College Test (ACT).
If you are pursuing the Accelerated Pre-Medicine Program, you must score a minimum of 1400 on the SAT I in one sitting
and take the SAT Subject Test in mathematics level I or level II, biology, and chemistry. All Accelerated Pre-Law applicants
must take two SAT Subject Tests of your choice.
We encourage you to begin taking these exams in your junior year of high school. If you are not applying as an Early Decision
candidate we recommend that you take all exams by December of your senior year so we can evaluate your scores in a timely
manner. Please keep in mind that the Admissions Committee looks at the highest score in the Critical Reading and Math
section of the SAT I to compute a total score.

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION
For complete information and registration forms of all tests, see your guidance/college counselor or contact the Educational
Testing Service (SAT), Princeton, NJ, 08540, www.sat.org, or the American College Testing Program (ACT), Iowa City, IA,
52243, www.act.org.

Personal Interview
Admissions offers an interview option to all students applying for undergraduate admission. Applicants should contact the
Office of Undergraduate Admissions at (201) 216-5194 to set up an interview. If you are applying for the Accelerated PreMedicine program, an interview is required. Interviews can be completed by phone, Skype or on campus.

Guidance Counselor/Teacher Evaluations
We require all applicants to submit at least one teacher evaluation and once guidance counselor evaluation, so we can learn
more about your academic and personal qualities, as well as your potential of becoming a successful Stevens student. You
will find the appropriate evaluation forms in your application and on our website.

Written Statement
At Stevens, we give you a written opportunity to provide us with information about yourself before the Admissions Committee
meets to determine an admissions decision. This may be a talent, fact, experience, or thought that you did not include on the
application or in your personal interview. Please complete the essay as part of your application to Stevens.

Completing the Application
Go to www.stevens.edu/sit/admissions/apply to access our application instructions. Stevens uses the Common Application
in addition to a private Stevens Application.

Deadlines
Applying for Freshman Admission
To be considered for admission to the fall class of first year students at Stevens, please submit your application and additional
information required, by February 1. You may submit application as soon as you complete your junior year of high school,
once the next cycle’s application is available. Once we receive all of the additional information required the Admissions
Committee will meet to review your file and make an admissions decision. Please note that students applying for accelerated
programs have a deadline of January 1.

Early Admission
Applying Early Decision - ED I
If Stevens is your first choice, you may apply for admission as an Early Decision candidate by November 15. One advantage
of applying Early Decision is that you will receive an admission decision, including notification of an estimated financial aid
package if you have applied for it, by December 15. If you are accepted to Stevens, you must submit your tuition deposit by
January 10th. We then ask you to withdraw applications from any other colleges and universities to which you have applied.
Applying Early Decision - ED II
Stevens also has an Early Decision II process. The application procedures are the same, however, the deadline for application
is January 15 with a notification date of February 15. If you are accepted to Stevens, you must submit your tuition deposit by
March 10th and then withdraw applications from any other colleges and universities to which you have applied.
To be considered for Early Decision, please indicate this on your application and submit it with all of the additional information
required by November 15 for ED I/January 15 for ED II.

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

18

UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION
Applying Early Admission
Under very special circumstances we will accept students who have finished their high school requirements at the end of
their junior year. You must adhere to the same requirements and deadlines as those applying for admission.

Advanced Placement
Stevens participates in the Advanced Placement (AP) Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. You may receive
college credit toward your degree for various examinations. For a detailed list and additional information, refer to the section
entitled Undergraduate Procedures and Requirements in this catalog. Be sure to list these exams and the scores received
on your application.

Stevens Link Semester
The Stevens Link Semester is a one-semester, foundational program for a select group of students to be offered conditional
admission to Stevens Institute of Technology for the fall term. Successful completion of the Link semester includes the
achievement of a 2.5 or better GPA in the fall term with a minimum of 12 earned credits, as well as satisfactory conduct. Any
students with a lower GPA will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Upon successful completion of the foundation semester,
Link students will be fully admitted to Stevens in their second semester. It is expected that students will be able to graduate
within four years depending on their academic performance. Participation in programs such as cooperative education may
result in a five-year timeframe. Questions can be directed to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at 800-STEVENS or
visit: http://www.stevens.edu/sit/admissions.

International Students
Admissions requirements and procedures for international applicants are the same as those for domestic candidates.
However, if your first or native language is not English, you are required take the Test of English as a Foreign Language
(TOEFL) and earn a score of at least 550 on the paper version or 80 on the internet based version. We also accept the
International English Language Testing System (IELTS) with a score of 6 or higher.
At Stevens, international students are not eligible for financial aid. There are limited merit-based scholarships for which you
do not need to apply (all applicants for admission are automatically considered). Additional sources of money for international
students include loan programs and the Stevens Cooperative Education Program; information about these programs can be
found in this catalogue.

Transfer Students
Stevens considers transfer students from community colleges and four-year institutions. To earn a degree from Stevens, you
must complete at least 50 percent of your degree requirement credits at Stevens and at least five courses must be technical
electives taken in the junior and senior years.
A minimum grade of “C” is required for undergraduate transfer credit. Courses taken on a pass/fail basis are not acceptable.
If a Stevens course includes a laboratory, then you must have also taken a laboratory. A syllabus or course description from
the institution’s catalog must be sent to ascertain equivalence. Since it is essential that all course prerequisites be met, you
should provide complete transcripts with descriptions of the courses and all educational experience as early as possible in
the application process. It is also advisable for you to visit with or write to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, Attn:
Transfer Admissions, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, (201) 216-5194. You may be asked to confer
with faculty in the departments in which you seek credit for courses taken elsewhere.
The application deadline for transfer admission to Stevens for the fall semester is July 1; November 1 for the spring semester.

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION
Part-time and Evening Study for Non-Traditional Students
Stevens does not offer the opportunity to pursue an undergraduate degree by attending part-time and/or solely in the
evening. If you want to pursue an undergraduate degree, you can do so on a full-time basis only, and you must register for
at least 12 credit hours per semester to be considered a full-time student.

The Campus Visit
An important step in selecting a school is visiting the campus. Not only does the admissions staff want to meet you, we
very much want you to see our beautiful and historic 55-acre campus overlooking the Hudson River and exciting New York
City. During your visit, you have the opportunity to explore our state-of-the-art laboratories, see our residence halls, and
meet professors and current students. A visit to Stevens also gives you an opportunity to present special circumstances,
qualifications, or interests that may help us determine your ability to succeed here.
Throughout the year, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions offers Information Sessions and Campus Visit Days for high
school juniors and seniors. These events include an overview of the university, academic programs, applying for admission,
and filing for financial aid. It also enables you to speak with current students and faculty, and take a tour of campus.
If you live far from campus, there are other options. Admissions representatives travel to a multitude of high schools
participating in college fairs. During the summer, you may also visit Stevens and make it a part of your family vacation.
Please call the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at (201) 216-5194 to discuss your campus visit plans or visit our Website
at http://www.stevens.edu/admissions for updated information.

20

UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION
the thesis does not affect the GPA
the thesis is not treated as an overload for tuition calculation
the student may begin work on the thesis before the senior year

Special Degree Programs
êê
There are a number of special programs available to students, depending on their area of study. A student planning to
enter any of the following special degree programs should discuss their plans with their Faculty Advisor and the Office of
Undergraduate Academics.

Simultaneous Degree Program
The Simultaneous Degree Program permits a student to complete the requirements for two degrees, scheduling and extra
credit rule permitting. A student may complete a bachelor’s and master’s degrees in four years. Two bachelor’s degrees (any
combination of B.E., B.A., and B.S.) must be completed simultaneously. A student must take at least 24 credits over and
above their first bachelor’s degree in order to earn a second degree.

Double B.E. Degree Program
The Double B.E. Degree Program enables a student to earn two B.E. degrees, but the students must satisfy all of the
requirements in both concentrations; this includes two Junior and Senior Design sequences. In addition, the student must
take at least 24 credits over and above the first B.E. degree.

4+1 Bachelor’s/Master’s Program
Students are selected for the program at the time of admission to Stevens. Students will be notified of their acceptance into this
program prior to April 1st of the senior year of high school. Students must confirm their participation in the program. Students
will be required to have a minimum 3.2 cumulative GPA at the end of their sophomore year to remain in the program.
Students in the program must complete their bachelor’s degrees in four years. The students will receive their master’s
degrees upon completing the graduate degree requirements in the fifth year. Students in the fifth year will have graduate
student status subject to the full-time graduate tuition. Students will receive a scholarship equal to 20 percent of the graduate
tuition in the fifth year.
Qualified students will apply for admission to a specific master’s degree program in their fifth semester. The application
starts with a screening process by the Office of Undergraduate Academics. Students are recommended to take two or three
graduate courses towards the master’s degree before they complete the bachelor’s degree.
Graduate academic advising will be done at the department level and each department will appoint a faculty member to serve
in this role. All students in the program will be required to have an approved master’s study plan by the end of the spring
semester of their junior year.

Double Major Program (College of Arts and Letters Only)
Students studying in the College of Arts and Letters can choose to double major by combining two disciplines from within
the College of Arts and Letters. In cases of double majors, just one degree will be conferred and transcripts will designate
the two major areas. Students can choose to combine any two CAL majors. If the double major contains a major in Science,
Technology, and Society students can choose whether the overall degree is a B.A. or B.S., by fulfilling the requirements
pertaining to each type of degree.

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

21

UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION
The six classes of the common core are counted for both majors. Students then have to take eight additional classes in each
major area. No upper-division course may be counted towards both majors. For example: if the first major is in philosophy
and the second in history, the two additional upper-division (300/400-level) classes that count toward the major in philosophy
must be in a third discipline. The same requirement holds for the combination with interdisciplinary majors, and all other
requirements for the single major apply. CAL 301, Seminar in Writing and Research Methods, or a research methods class,
only has to be taken in one of the major areas.
Students choose in which major to write the B.A. thesis. The second major requires an extra tutorial course in addition to
all the other requirements of the major with one of the following options in place of a second thesis: 1) research paper, 2)
creative project, 3) portfolio, 4) musical composition or curated exhibit, 5) performance, 6) other similar project approved
and monitored by the student’s faculty advisor in consultation with the student. Alternatively, students may also opt for one
thesis that incorporates both majors. This work must be more extensive in length and scope than the single degree thesis,
and is subject to the approval of both advisors.

Accelerated Degree Programs

Fund (EOF) Program (http://www.state.nj.us/highereducation/EOF/EOF_Eligibility.shtml).
STEP Bridge is a challenging six-week college-level summer residential program for incoming freshmen. It helps students
begin their transition from high school to college in general, and Stevens in particular. During Bridge the pre-freshmen
network with upperclassmen, create friendships with classmates, and develop relationships with STEP staff and faculty
members. Students either are required to attend Bridge as a condition of their admission to Stevens, or apply to attend
the summer program. Any Stevens’ undergraduate who did not participate in Bridge is welcome to join STEP during the
academic year.
The New Jersey Educational Opportunity Fund (EOF) Program is a state-funded financial aid and support program offered
to students who meet the state-mandated financial and education guidelines. EOF students receive a financial award and
specific support services. All freshmen receiving an EOF grant are required to attend Bridge and are considered members
of STEP.

Cooperative Education
êê
Cooperative Education is a five-year educational program where students alternate between semesters of full time study and
full time work in areas related to their academic studies and career interests. The Co-op Program assists students in clarifying
their career aspirations while experiencing the connection between the theories learned in the classroom and applied in
the workplace.
Students’ first year is dedicated to completing freshman year academic requirements and attending Co-op meetings to
understand the rotational nature of the program, to prepare for the recruitment process, and to gain an understanding of

Stevens provides advising services to students interested in pursuing a career in the health professions. To make yourself
a desirable candidate for admission to such programs, you will need an education that includes a strong foundation in the
sciences, highly developed communication skills, and a solid background in the social sciences and humanities.
Students who are considering a career in the health professions should begin exploring their options early in their career
at Stevens. They should inquire about the requirements of specific schools and plan their studies at Stevens accordingly.
Students are NOT required to choose a science major in order to apply to medical school, although majors such as Biology,
Chemical Biology, or Biomedical Engineering include the courses that are typically required for application to medical school
in their curricula, so choosing one of those majors may make a student’s course planning a bit easier, but you can incorporate
the required courses into many majors including, but not limited to, chemistry, chemical engineering, physics, humanities,
arts, business, and other engineering majors.
Students who are planning to begin medical school or dental school immediately after graduation from Stevens should plan to
complete all of the minimum required courses listed by the schools in which they are interested by the end of your junior year
at Stevens to help ensure they are prepared to take the appropriate national exam (the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT)
for medical school or the Dental Admission Test (DAT) for dental school) that same spring. Although many students choose
to begin professional school immediately after graduation from undergraduate school, there is a strong national trend toward
adding one or more years of experience between undergraduate school and professional school, providing more flexibility in
undergraduate course scheduling and choice of undergraduate major as well as the potential to study abroad. Stevens faculty
advisors will help you to decide which plan is best for you. In addition to excellent grades and excellent test scores, you will also
benefit from experience in clinical settings (e.g., Emergency Medical Technician/First Aid training, hospital or medical/dental
office volunteering), research laboratories where you can develop your power of inquiry and logic, leadership and service. A
variety of student clubs as well as your academic advisors can help to make these connections for you.

Health Professions Advisory Committee
The Health Professions Advisory Committee (HPAC) helps students prepare to apply to medical (MD and DO) or dental school,
and also provides advice for students interested in advancing toward careers such as physician’s assistants, physical therapy,
pharmacy, and veterinary medicine. The HPAC meets with groups of students on a periodic basis, interviews individual
applicants as applications draw near, collects letters of recommendation on behalf of applicants, and writes the Committee

UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION
letter for the student’s applications. HPAC also holds seminars to discuss the application requirements and procedures, and
any changes in the application process. The HPAC includes faculty with expertise in science and engineering, literature and
social sciences, business/healthcare management, and undergraduate academic administration.

Health Professions Student Organizations
In an effort to support those interested in the healthcare field, Stevens supports two active student organizations: the Stevens
Health Professionals Club (SHPC) and Alpha Epsilon Delta (AED).
SHPC is dedicated to providing educational and volunteer opportunities for students aspiring for a career in
healthcare. Through programs offered on and off campus, students interested in an array of areas of healthcare will
benefit from guest speakers representing various careers, introductions to and advice from members of professional
school admissions committees, and access to volunteer opportunities at hospitals and EMS training courses. AED
is a national health pre-professional honor society dedicated to recognizing and encouraging those committed to
healthcare. The organization strives to organize events each semester focused on philanthropy, scholarship, and
social issues to promote the awareness of healthcare on campus and within the Hoboken community.

Recommended Courses
Typically, the following courses are recommended for students who are interested in applying to medical or dental-school.
These courses usually satisfy the admissions requirements to accredited U.S. medical and dental schools:
Two years of chemistry with lab (CH 115, 116, 117, 118; CH 243, CH 244, CH 245, CH 246)
The biology sequence BIO 281 and BIO 381, and then either BIO 382 or BME 482 (Please note that the lab
portions of CH 381 and either CH 382 or BME 482 are used to satisfy the requirement for two biology labs)
One year of physics with lab (PEP 111, 112, 221, 222)
Eight credits of mathematics (MA 121, 122, 123, 124)
One year of English, including writing and composition (any two HUM 100-level courses)
Please Note: Most U.S. medical and dental schools will NOT accept AP courses from high school, courses
taken abroad, or courses taken at community colleges to satisfy the basic chemistry, biology, physics, math, and
English courses.
In addition to the courses outlined above, the following are typically recommended to help students prepare for the MCAT,
which was revised in 2015 and now includes a significant emphasis on psychology, sociology, and biochemistry:
Genetics
Biochemistry (CH 580 and CH 581)
Immunology
Physiology
Biological psychology
Bioethics
Probability & Statistics

(973) 763-3078 or (973) 761-9446.

Sponsored Senior Design Program
êê
The Sponsored Senior Design Program provides an opportunity for a team of engineering and/or computer science students
to select a two-semester sponsored design project. Typically, the sponsoring organization proposes one or more project topics,
primary goals and essential design requirements. The student team will collaboratively work with technical mentors from the
sponsoring organization and faculty advisor(s) to develop and evaluate solutions that meet the sponsor’s requirements. The
students are expected to present periodic reviews on design concepts; analysis, testing and optimization results; detailed
designs, and prototypes of hardware and software systems, to the sponsor. Prior to the commencement of the project,
the sponsor, the students and the institute will enter into an agreement that stipulates the project expectations, fees and
assignment of intellectual property rights.

Study Abroad
êê
Studying Abroad is one of the most important activities that college students may do for their personal development, their
career, and to prepare for the world they will enter after graduation. In the global society in which we live today, it is becoming
increasingly essential to have an understanding of and appreciation for different people, cultures, and how others see things
and address challenges, both in business and everyday life. Participating in a Study Abroad Program or other education
abroad experience will add another dimension to a student’s resume, help them gain a global perspective, and allow them to
recognize the value of international cooperation.
Undergraduates who have completed at least one year of study at Stevens, and who have a 2.75 cumulative GPA have the option
to participate in a semester long education abroad experience. They are also able to study on short term faculty led programs,
primarily in the summer, engage in research, internships or enroll in courses at partner universities located around the world.
Seniors may also participate in summer or other short term programs offered by Stevens or other affiliates and partners.
Short-term opportunities include Stevens Faculty Led Programs at foreign destinations, and research programs at international
facilities or universities. Past destinations have included Ecuador, England, Greece, Italy, Malaysia, Spain, the Netherlands,
and Norway. Some short-term programs may offer students the opportunity to earn academic credits.
Semester abroad programs are study abroad experiences in which students enroll for a semester at partner universities
located around the world. Students select a university which offers courses which are then pre-approved for transfer to
Stevens and which meet graduation requirements. Stevens offers several established options for study abroad experiences.
Among them are exchange programs with the Universidad Pontificia Comillas in Spain, Beijing Institute of Technology in

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

27

UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION
China, KTH in Sweden and the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Stevens also partners with University College
Dublin in Ireland, Queen Mary: University of London, Budapest University of Technology and Economics in Hungary, and
the University of Nicosia in Cyprus. Stevens also partners with several study abroad providers, including Academic Programs
International (API), Global Semesters Inc., International Studies Abroad (ISA), The Education Abroad Network (TEAN), and
CIS Abroad, to name a few.
The decision of when to study abroad is made after discussions with the Academic Advisor, Co-op Counselor (if appropriate)
and the Director of International Programs. Students are advised to select the semester or summer which best fits their
academic curriculum, and does not delay their graduation.
Stevens’s students who have participated in study-abroad programs and other international education experiences report
that it enriched their lives, and enhanced their opportunities for employment and/or professional studies.
For more information view www.stevens.edu/studyabroad, contact studyabroad@stevens.edu, or visit the Office of
International Programs, Edward A. Stevens Building, Room 119B.

Undergraduate Procedures and Requirements
A more detailed description of undergraduate academic policies and procedures can be found at https://www.stevens.edu/

classes, you receive an “Exc.”

Faculty regulations concerning the abbreviations “Abs.” for absent and “Inc.” for incomplete can be found on the
Undergraduate Academics Web site at https://www.stevens.edu/about-stevens/university-policy-library/undergraduateacademics/undergraduate-academics-policies-and-procedures. Stevens uses the Quality Points System to determine grade
Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

28

UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION
point averages (GPA). This means an “A” in a three semester-hour course is worth three times more than an “A” in a one
semester-hour course. To determine the number of quality points for any course, the semester hours are multiplied by the
value of the letter grade received for the course. To determine the weighted average, the sum of quality points is divided by
the sum of quality hours.

Examinations
êê
All students must take a written examination at the end of each term in all major-required core courses. Examinations in all
technical, engineering, humanities, and management electives are at the option of the specific department(s).

Grade Point Averages
êê
The Office of the Registrar calculates three different GPAs for each student:
The semester GPA is determined from all courses taken at Stevens during a semester.
The graduating GPA is calculated from all courses taken at Stevens that are part of the degree requirement. If a
course is repeated, the new grade replaces the old grade for purposes of calculating the graduating GPA, even
if the new grade is lower than previous grade(s). Please note that if a course that has been passed previously is
retaken, and a grade of F or W is recorded for the retaken course, then the course is considered as having been
passed and the previous grade will be used in calculating the graduating GPA. If a course is repeated outside of
Stevens with a grade of C or better, then a grade of C is used to calculate the graduating GPA.
The ranking GPA is calculated from all courses that are part of the degree requirement. In this case, all repeated
courses are included and repeated courses taken outside of Stevens are calculated as a “C.”

Grade Changes
êê
A final grade in a course may be changed only if an error in grading or grade computation was made, or if an Incomplete/
Absence petition was approved and filed before the end of the semester in which the course was taken. If one of these
circumstances applies, a grade may be changed within one regular (spring or fall) semester after the term in which the
course was taken.

Graduation Requirements
êê
To be eligible for graduation, you must have a “C” average (2.00 GPA) for eight terms of work and pass all required courses
for your curriculum. Each course which is part of an undergraduate degree program must be passed within no more than
three attempts.

Course Options
êê
Course by Examination
Course by examination is open to students with a GPA of 3.0 or better either in the previous semester or overall, and is limited
to one per semester. Permission to take a course by examination must be obtained on a Request for a Course by Examination
form from the instructor, student advisor, and the Office of Undergraduate Academics.
If the examination is successfully completed, the instructor who administered the examination issues a letter grade in the
course. The examination must be taken prior to the start of a semester, and if the examination is not passed, the unsuccessful

31

UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION
attempt is recorded as part of the student’s permanent record, and the student must enroll in that course in the following
semester.
A course that has already been attempted by a student cannot subsequently be taken as a Course by Examination.

Course by Application
If a particular course is not offered through the regular schedule, the course may be taken by application with the approval of
the instructor, the Department Director, and the Office of Undergraduate Academics on a Request for a Course by Application
form. Regular enrollment is required, and arrangements are made for the student to study the material and be tested during
the semester. A letter grade is issued at the end of the semester.

Extra Courses
Freshman, during the first academic year, are not allowed to take extra classes beyond the number of courses in their major.
Taking extra courses beyond a program’s normal load is a serious matter. While the Office of Undergraduate Academics does
not encourage overloading, any overload consideration must be discussed and approved by that office. The following are the
criteria for overloading:
After the first year, the students may enroll in an extra class with the permission of the Office of Undergraduate Academics
and a GPA of 3.3 or higher in the previous full-time semester. The students with an extra course and 3.6 or higher GPA may
enroll in two extra courses. The GPA requirements above can also be met by the student’s cumulative GPA.
The baseline definition for the regular course load is the maximum number of credits for the student’s major in any of the
semesters of the program in the catalog for the student’s entrance year. An additional per credit tuition fee will apply for
students who overload.

Auditing Courses
To audit a course is to attend classes without receiving credit for the course. A student may do this with approval from
the Office of Undergraduate Academics. This course will count as an enrolled course for purposes of computing overload
charges, should any be required. In order to change from credit to audit status or audit to credit status in a class, student
must file a Change of Enrollment (Add/Drop) form in the Registrar’s Office before the Add/Drop deadline established by the
Registrar.

Pass/Fail
If a student is on the Dean’s List or has a 3.00 average, one course per semester may be selected under a pass-fail grading
system, subject to the Advisor’s approval. The course must be an extra undergraduate course beyond the requirements
for the undergraduate degree. The course must be clearly designated on the study plan or application for candidacy as
either “extra” or “outside the area of concentration.” No graduate course may be taken under the pass-fail grading system
regardless of its status. You have until the mid-term date of the semester to designate a course as pass-fail.

Dropping/Withdrawing from Courses
Individual courses may be dropped during the Add/Drop Period in the first two weeks of each semester (one week in summer
sessions) by submitting a Change of Enrollment Form to the Office of the Registrar. When a course is dropped, no record of
the student’s enrollment in the course remains on the student transcript.
After the Add/Drop Period has passed, students may withdraw from a course up to one week before the last day of classes.
When a student withdraws from a course, a grade of “W” is recorded on the transcript. . The grade of “W” does not affect the

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

32

UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION
student’s graduating GPA. International students should consult with the Office of International Student and Scholar Services
before withdrawing from a course.

Dean’s List
The Dean’s List is prepared at the end of each academic term by the Registrar’s Office. To be eligible for a given semester,
you must be in good standing, earn at least 12 credits, and have a 3.5 term GPA with no failures and no more than one
course withdrawal.

Reduced Load Program
êê
The Reduced Load Program has two options:

Freshman Option
Permits freshmen to take one fewer technical course for each of the first two semesters. The courses are made up tuition
free during the summer immediately following the freshman year. The deadline to sign up is the start of the second semester.
To register for the tuition free courses, students must visit the Office of Undergraduate Academics during registration to
complete Change of Enrollment form(s).

Reduced Load Option
Reduces the student’s work load in each semester by lengthening the time from entrance to graduation from eight to ten
semesters. Students who are accepted into the Reduced Load Option receive full tuition waiver in the 9th and 10th semesters.
The waiver of full tuition does not extend beyond the 10th semester. The deadline to sign up is the end of the third semester
for engineering students and the end of the second semester for all other students.
Students may elect to change their participation from the Freshman Option to the Reduced Load option after their first two
semesters. Students who elect to make this change forfeit the free summer classes offered through the Freshman Option.
Continued participation in the Reduced Load Option is contingent upon maintenance of a curricular program that does not
exceed “reduced load” status for the appropriate field of study while paying the current full semester tuition. Explicit in this
condition is a forfeiture of the student’s right to exercise the “extra course” provision. This forfeiture does not prohibit students
from pursuing certain program enhancements such as minors following specific approval from the Office of Undergraduate
Academics.
Students may, during the 9th and 10th semesters, qualify for limited financial aid. Merit scholarships are strictly limited to eight
semesters. In all cases, it is the student’s responsibility to complete all applicable financial aid forms. Students are strongly
urged to contact the Office of Financial Aid for details.
Contact the Office of Undergraduate Academics to discuss the options above.

English Language Requirement for International Students
êê
Undergraduate international students will be placed in CAL 101 during their first semester. After successful completion of
CAL 101, international students must take CAL 103, followed by CAL 105. A diagnostic will be administered during the first
week of CAL 101 and students who surpass the requirements of the diagnostic may transfer to CAL 103. CAL 101 may be
used to satisfy a general or free elective requirement. Subsequently, all undergraduate international students must complete
the remaining humanities courses required for their degree program.

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION

Online Graduate Courses for Undergraduate Students
êê
Undergraduate students may, with junior or senior standing, a 3.0 or higher GPA, and the permission of their advisor, enroll
in up to two online graduate courses per semester. Students with a 3.2 or higher GPA may take a third web course. These
classes are counted as part of the students’ regular semester credit load for purposes of computing overload charges, if any
apply. Students wishing to take more than two (or three with a GPA of 3.2 or higher) online courses require the permission
of the Office of Undergraduate Academics, and will incur additional charges at the undergraduate per-credit tuition rate for
these classes regardless of whether or not they exceed the credit-load limit. Undergraduates are not permitted to enroll in the
winter or the Spring 2 WebCampus semesters. Online graduate courses may not include more than two 600- or higher-level
courses per semester and those courses require a separate permission process.
International students in F-1 immigration status should keep in mind that immigration regulations permit them to count
only one online course (3 credits) toward their full-time requirement in each regular (fall and spring) semester. Therefore,
while Stevens permits them to take 2 online courses per semester at no additional cost, they must generally be enrolled in
a minimum of 15 credits, at least 9 of which must be in regular on-campus courses, in order to do this and still maintain
their immigration status. For additional details and questions, please contact the Office of International Student and Scholar
Services. http://www.stevens.edu/directory/international-student-and-scholar-services

Non-matriculated Students
êê
Students wishing to take a course at Stevens on a non-matriculated basis must obtain approval from the Office of Undergraduate
Academics. A minimum 3.0 GPA at the student’s current or previous college or university is required, in addition to completion
of the equivalent of all pre-requisite courses for the desired Stevens course. Tuition is charged on a per-credit basis. For details
regarding course offerings, visit the Office of the Registrar’s web site at http://www.stevens.edu/directory/office-registrar

Academic Leave of Absence/Withdrawal from Stevens
êê
Students seeking a Leave of Absence or Withdrawal should appear in person to the Office of Undergraduate Academics
(OUA) located in Edwin A. Stevens Building Room 119. Withdrawing from Stevens means that the student no longer plans to
continue his/her education at Stevens. Leave of Absence (LOA) means that the student plans to return to Stevens to continue
his/her education. Students wishing to take a voluntary leave of absence from Stevens can do so for up to 6 months or one
semester. Transcripts will be reviewed to determine readmission eligibility and conditions. Students who do not return to
Stevens within 6 months or one semester will be classified as withdrawn. LOA/Withdrawal Form can be found on the OUA
website. http://www.stevens.edu/directory/undergraduate-academics
Students should contact the Office of Financial Aid for questions regarding the impact a leave or withdrawal will have on
loans and/or scholarships.
Note: Undergraduate students must apply for readmission within 7 years from the date of the leave of absence or withdrawal
from Stevens. An undergraduate degree must be completed within 12 years of entrance to Stevens.

Administrative Leave of Absence
êê
Students may be placed on an Administrative (involuntary) Leave of Absence for any of the below reasons:
Financial: If a student is not able to meet his/her financial obligations for the semester or has an outstanding
balance from a previous semester/year
Medical/Mental Health: as determined by professional staff member(s)

Disciplinary: as determined by Student Affairs or by the Honor Board
Academic: as determined by the Academic Promotions Committee
Not Enrolled: students who do not register for classes by the end of the drop/add period for the semester

Physical Education (P.E.) Requirements
êê
The Office of Physical Education conducts a structured instructional class program which provides students with knowledge
and skills in a wide range of lifetime, team, dance and wellness oriented activities.
Students participate in a multitude of sport pursuits which can be enjoyed both during college and beyond. Examples of the
types of classes available include: archery, basketball, boot camp, bowling, core and sculpt, CPR certification, fencing, fly
fishing, golf, women’s golf, indoor cycling, leadership, Olympic weight lifting, outdoor adventure, Pilates, racquetball, sailing,
soccer, squash, strength and conditioning, swimming, tai chi, tennis, yoga and Zumba.
The following are the P.E. graduation requirements for all Stevens students for non-academic credit. They will appear on the
student record as pass/fail. All students must complete four Physical Education (P.E.) courses.
All four P.E. courses must be completed by the end of the sixth semester.
Students are encouraged to enroll in more than the minimum four required P.E. courses.
Participation in varsity sports can be used to satisfy up to three of the P.E. requirements.
The Physical Education course offerings are updated on an annual basis to meet the needs and interests of the student body.

GRADUATE EDUCATION
Change of Program
A student who wishes to change to a different program prior to the first day of the semester is treated as a new student
applying for admission and must fill out a new application. Students wishing to change to a different program after the first
day of the semester should fill out a program change form which must be submitted to the Office of Graduate Admissions,
after which the student’s file is then sent to the new department for a separate admission decision. The student must then
complete a new Study Plan, and all previously completed coursework must be evaluated for transfer into the new program.
Acceptance of such credits is entirely at the discretion of the department and must be approved by the Dean of Graduate
Academics.

Deferring Admission
Newly admitted students may request to defer their acceptance for one semester. Students who have not enrolled within one
year of their acceptance must reapply through the Office of Graduate Admissions. The student’s file will be reviewed and a
decision letter will be sent to the student.

Degree Programs
Stevens Institute of Technology offers graduate programs in engineering, science, systems engineering, management, and
the liberal arts. Programs lead to one of over 50 different advanced degree designations from the Master’s to the Doctor
of Philosophy degree. The graduate programs are intended to enable professionals to advance in industries increasingly
influenced by technology and also to enable scholars to explore the frontiers of their disciplines. Students may attend
graduate courses on a full-time or part-time basis, with many students attending classes at off-campus corporate cites.
Students may complete a prescribed course sequence or engage in research activity that generates new knowledge in
pursuit of an advanced degree.

Master’s Programs
êê
A Master’s program may be thought of as an extension or completion of the higher level of education already achieved
in undergraduate studies. It may be an exploration in some depth of a particular area of science, engineering, computer
science, information systems, management, or liberal arts, or it may be intended as a first step toward a doctoral degree.
Since the master’s degree carries with it the designation of the department in which it is earned, you must follow a Study
Plan that your faculty advisor approves as satisfactory for the requirements of the degree and adequate to your particular
needs. Upon request of the Dean of Graduate Academics you may arrange an interdisciplinary program designating at least
two professors to supervise the major areas of study. For more information regarding Interdisciplinary programs, please see
additional information below.
For the master’s degree, you must earn no less than 30 credits, 15 of which must be in your major’s department. Additional
requirements may be required by the department offering the program. Interdisciplinary programs are exempt from the
requirements of 15 credits in one department. Thesis requirements, if any, vary with the department. In general, a master’s
thesis is optional for part-time students, but required by some departments of full-time students who are supported graduate
assistants or are continuing on to the doctorate. For specific program requirements, please visit your Department’s section
of the Academic Catalog.

GRADUATE EDUCATION

Engineer Programs
êê
The Engineers degree is a terminal professional degree beyond the master’s degree. The purpose of the Engineer program is
to advance the training of engineers beyond the master’s level and to provide modern education for engineers whose master’s
degrees are not recent. A design project carrying from 8 to 15 credits is required. Five programs, each of 60 credits, beyond
the bachelor’s degree, are offered, leading to the degrees of:
Chemical Engineer
Civil Engineer
Computer Engineer
Computer Science Engineer
Electrical Engineer
Mechanical Engineer
Physics

Doctoral Programs
êê
Doctoral programs are specifically designed for students to ultimately lead an independent investigation of a problem within
their field allowing them to make significant contributions to that particular body of knowledge. While part of this involves
acquiring existing knowledge in their field, doctoral students’ fundamental objective is to develop their skills and capacity to
conduct original research. Therefore, the preliminary requirements for the doctorate are regarded not as ends in themselves,
but rather as preparation for the dissertation in which the student demonstrates ability.
As doctoral students pursue research in a particular field of science, engineering, or management, they will develop their
study plan in preliminary conferences with a faculty advisor from the relevant department and all concerned faculty members.
In addition to the general admissions requirements, students must satisfy the standards for qualifications established by their
department. Approval is generally only given when a student has completed work equivalent to a master’s degree.
A prior master’s degree may be transferred for up to 30 credits without specific course descriptions with approval of the
department and the Dean of Graduate Academics. Up to one-third of additional course credits may be transferred with the
approval of the thesis committee and the Dean of Graduate Academics. The grade of “B” (3.0 GPA) or better is required for
such courses and such courses may not have been already used to obtain an academic degree.
The Dean of Graduate Academics, at the request of the student, may arrange an interdisciplinary program. To oversee and
approve such a program, the Dean of Graduate Academics, on the advice of faculty responsible for the programs involved,
will designate a professor from each of the pertinent disciplinary areas to serve on a special supervisory committee. The
committee chairpersons will ordinarily be the professors who will supervise the student’s research. Examination requirements
for interdisciplinary programs will be tailored appropriately and administered through the Dean of Graduate Academics.
Individual departments may require proficiency in a foreign language appropriate to the area of a doctoral candidate’s
proposed dissertation. This proficiency will be tested by an examination set by the department at least one year before
graduation. Individual departments may require an additional language.
Before a department approves a candidate for the doctorate, the candidate must have demonstrated to the Dean of Graduate
Academics that the language requirements, if any, have been satisfied; that the qualifying or comprehensive and preliminary
examinations in the major and minor areas of study have been passed; and that the research program for a dissertation has
been approved.

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

39

GRADUATE EDUCATION
Within six months of becoming a doctoral candidate, the student needs to select a Research Advisor and agree upon a
research topic. The Research Advisor will request that the Department Director nominate additional members of the Advisory
Committee. A dissertation committee is composed of at least four persons, one of whom must be a Stevens professor from
another department or program. It is permissible and desirable to have as a committee member a highly qualified person
from outside Stevens. The chair or co-chair must be a tenure track, full-time professor, professor emeritus, or a person
employed in an academic capacity at Stevens who has been approved through a process determined by the particular school
of his/her employment. A Dissertation Advisory Committee Appointment form is completed and submitted to the Dean of
Graduate Academics for approval. Usually, the student’s Research Advisor serves as Chairman of the Advisory Committee.
The student and the Advisory Committee must meet at least once a year and report to the Dean of Graduate Academics that
the meeting was held.
Upon appointment of the Advisory Committee the candidate will prepare and defend a research proposal. The institute
requires that the candidate take the Stevens “Signature” course PRV961 which is intended to broaden the PhD educational
experience. This may be done concurrently with the preparation of the proposal.
Within two weeks after the beginning of the semester in which the student expects to complete the requirements for the
doctorate an application for candidacy for the degree must be filed at the Registrar’s Office. A dissertation, in which the
student presents the results of their research in a form worthy of publication, must be submitted to the committee at least
six weeks before the date on which they expect to receive their degree. After the advisory committee accepts the student’s
dissertation, a date will be set for a public oral examination to defend it. The defense must take place at least two weeks
before commencement. At the time of the defense, at least one manuscript based on dissertation work must be submitted
for publication.

Interdisciplinary Programs
êê
Interdisciplinary graduate programs promote intellectual growth and offer distinct challenges to conventional thinking. They
address areas that are too broad or too complex to be dealt with adequately by a single academic discipline. Interdisciplinary
programs are essential for the education of graduate students involved in projects concerned with the nurturing of technology
from concept to realization. It is also the case that some interesting scholarly areas involve the blending of two or more
academic disciplines, for example, management science juxtaposes operations research and business.
Students interested in an interdisciplinary program at either the Master’s or Ph.D. level may proceed as follows:
The student applies to Stevens Institute of Technology as an interdisciplinary student and outlines the program
he or she would like to undertake.
The Office of Graduate Admissions forwards the application to the Dean of Graduate Academics. The Dean of
Graduate Academics forwards the application to the appropriate departments/programs for consideration.
The departments/programs render their decisions and report them to the Dean of Graduate Academics.
If all decisions are positive, the Dean of Graduate Academics informs the appropriate directors and appoints
advisors for the preparation of a Study Plan and mentoring of the student.
The Dean of Graduate Academics formally informs the Office of Graduate Admissions the status of the application.
If all decisions are positive, admission is granted; else admission is not granted.
The student must complete a Study Plan and submit to the Dean of Graduate Academics for approval. Upon
approval, the Study Plan is sent to the Office of the Registrar.

GRADUATE EDUCATION

Graduate Certificate Programs
êê
Graduate Certificates are organized for practicing engineers, applied scientists, and managers to keep abreast of the newest
techniques and their applications in selected disciplines. Most graduate certificates consist of four graduate courses often of
an applied nature, and the information and understanding gained in the courses can be immediately applied to the solution
of on-the-job problems. One course taken at another institution may be transferred to the graduate certificate with faculty
approval. The grade of “B” (3.0 GPA) or better is required for such a course, and it may not have been already used to
obtain an academic degree. A Graduate Certificate is awarded upon satisfactory completion (i.e. a 3.0 GPA in the courses of
the program not including a transferred course) of the graduate courses required for the program. In most instances, these
courses may be applied towards a graduate degree.

Online Programs
êê
Stevens students can take courses online for graduate credit and non-credit through WebCampus. A complete listing of
WebCampus courses can be found at www.stevens.edu/webcampus. Designed for those who, because of distance or other
commitments, cannot attend class at either Stevens’ Hoboken campus or at off-campus corporate locations, WebCampus
courses are delivered worldwide by the same superior faculty who teach in conventional classroom settings. Currently, there
are 45 Graduate Certificates and 19 Master’s programs available online through WebCampus.

Graduate Procedures and Requirements
A more detailed description of graduate academic policies and procedures can be found in the Graduate Student Handbook.

Academic Standing
êê
The lowest passing grade for graduate courses is “C-,” and “F” is failure.
Students must maintain a “B” (3.0) grade point average to remain in satisfactory academic standing in a graduate program.
Students may be placed on probation if they a) have less than a “B” average b) have received a “C” and/or a “C-” in three
or more courses c) have received an “F” in a course that has been improve by repeating it.

GRADUATE EDUCATION
The Office of the Registrar calculates three different GPAs for each student:
The semester GPA is determined from all courses taken at Stevens during a semester.
The graduating GPA is calculated from all courses taken at Stevens that are part of the degree requirement. If a
course is repeated, only the last grade is used, even if the last grade is lower than previous grade.
The ranking GPA is calculated from all courses that are part of the degree requirement. In this case, all repeated
courses are included.

Special Grades
êê
The following grades are given under the specified conditions:
“AUD” - audit

A student who registers to audit a course, pays the full fee, but does not receive a terminal grade
or credit.

“ABS” - absent

This grade indicates that the student was absent from the final examination with approval of the
instructor and the Dean of Graduate Academics.
The approval must be obtained through the use of the INC/ABS petition form available from
the Student Services Center. The petition form must be filed within thirty days of the final
examination date. After the student takes the examination, a Change of Grade form will be
submitted by the instructor, giving a terminal grade for the course.
Under normal circumstances, but subject to the discretion of the Dean of the Graduate
Academics, a grade of F will be given for the course if the instructor does not submit a terminal
grade before the agreed upon date.

“INC” - incomplete

Indicates that the student filed a petition form that is available from the Office of the Registrar.
The petition must be filed no later than the last regular class meeting.
Generally, an incomplete grade is granted to a person having been in the class for at least 10
class sessions, who is in good academic standing in the course, and has completed all the
course requirements due within that time period. This grade is given at the discretion of the
instructor.
The incomplete must be made up within one year unless an extension is granted by the Dean of
Graduate Academics.

“S/U” - satisfactory/
unsatisfactory

Indicate satisfactory or unsatisfactory respectively and are in progress grades, used as an interim
grade for special problems courses, master’s theses, engineer projects and doctoral dissertation.

“NG” - no grade

It is a temporary notation issued to students by the Registrar in the following situations:
– a grade has not been entered on the grade sheet for a student
– “W”, “INC”, or “ABS” has been entered on a grade sheet, but no petition has been filed or
approved

“W” - withdrawal

Students are automatically approved to withdraw from a class if it is before the end of the tenth
class session. After the tenth class session, students need the permission of the instructor and
Dean of Graduate Academics to withdraw from a course.
A “W” will appear on your transcript but does not affect your GPA.

Grade Changes
êê
A final grade in a course may be changed only if a) an error in grading or grade computation was made, or b) an Inc./Abs.
petition was approved and filed before the end of the semester in which the course was taken. If one of these circumstances
applies, a grade may be changed within one regular (Spring or Fall) semester after the term in which the course was taken.

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

GRADUATE EDUCATION

Graduation Requirements
êê
In order to graduate a student must obtain (1) a minimum of a “B” average (3.0 GPA) average in their major and (2) an
overall average of “B” (3.0 GPA) in the courses required to meet the requirements for the degree. A maximum of six years
is allowed for completion of the degree, unless an extension has been requested by the student and granted by the Dean of
Graduate Academics.

Transferring Credits
êê
Up to 9 transfer credits may be accepted toward a 30 credit Master’s degree or 12 transfer credits toward a 36 credit Master’s
degree or a 48 credit MBA degree, if these credits have not already been used to obtain an academic degree. All credits for
transfer must show grades of “B” (3.0 GPA) or better, and the courses must be approved by the appropriate departments
and submitted to the Registrar’s Office.

Course Options
êê
Course by Application
If a particular course is not offered through the regular schedule, the course may be taken by application with the approval
of the instructor, the Department Director, the Office of Graduate Academics on a Request for Course by Application form.
Regular enrollment is required, and arrangements are made for the student to study the material and be tested out during
the semester. A letter grade is issued at the end of the semester.

Auditing Courses
To audit a course is to attend classes without receiving credit for the course. A student may do this with approval from the
Office of Graduate Academics. Under no circumstances can you change to credit status or take the course for credit at a
future time.

Dropping/Withdrawing from Courses
Individual courses may be dropped during the Add/Drop Period in the first two weeks of each semester (one week in summer
sessions) by submitting a Change of Enrollment Form to the Office of the Registrar. When a course is dropped, no record of
the student’s enrollment in the course remains on the student transcript.
After the Add/Drop Period has passed, students may withdraw from a course up to one week before the last day of classes.
When a student withdraws from a course, a grade of “W” is recorded on the transcript. The grade of “W” does not affect the
student’s graduating GPA. International students should consult with the Office of International Student and Scholar Services
before withdrawing from a course because it could have implications on immigration status.

English Language Proficiency Requirements for International Students
êê
​The ability to communicate effectively in English — to read, write and speak the language fluently — is vital for Stevens
graduate students. Therefore, every international applicant must demonstrate English language proficiency by submitting
the results of a TOEFL or an IELTS test.
Depending on TOEFL/IELTS scores, some students may be required to take an English Language Communications course
during their first semester at Stevens. Those students will receive a letter from the English Language Communication (ELC)
staff during orientation that informs them of their course placement. For detailed information about scores and associated

requirements, please refer to the English Language Proficiency Policy on the Office of Graduate Admissions website. If you
have specific questions about the ELC policy or courses, please email Sophie Hales, ELC Coordinator at shales@stevens.edu,
or Helene Beck, Assistant ELC Coordinator at hbeck@stevens.edu.

English Language Communication (ELC) Courses
ELC 71: Language and Communication in Academic Contexts (6 hours; 4 credits)
ELC 71 focuses on improving critical reading skills, developing effective listening strategies, gaining intelligibility in speaking,
and acquiring familiarity with academic writing conventions. Through a variety of materials and task based activities, students
will gain competence in writing well organized, coherent, and grammatically correct texts. Class discussions, text analysis,
and teamwork will enhance students’ analytical skills and promote confidence in social interaction in an English-speaking
environment. Additional required work in the Language Laboratory will also improve informal communication, as well as the
ability to give formal presentations.

ELC 81 Writing and Speaking for Academic Purposes I (4 hours; 2 credits)
ELC 81 focuses on improving academic writing skills through emphasis on specific tasks, including email, summary, and
problem-solution writing, which are necessary for success at the graduate level. There is additional focus on improving
speaking and listening strategies for academic, social, and professional interaction, which includes an understanding of how
these two skills are related. A variety of materials and task-based activities help students gain competence and confidence in
writing and speaking, both formally and informally. Additionally, required attendance in the Language Laboratory will enhance
students’ intelligibility in social and academic situations.

ELC 91 Writing and Speaking for Academic Purposes II (4 hours; 2 credits)
ELC 91 helps students position themselves as successful members of the graduate community by exploring the effective
use of academic conventions. Resolving questions of rhetoric through text analysis, class discussions, and collaborative
activities strengthens critical reading, thinking, and academic writing skills. A variety of genre-specific tasks help students
improve communication of both sourced/non-sourced and verbal/non-verbal (graphs, tables, etc.) information. Additionally,
refining critical elements of pronunciation through class and Language Laboratory work will improve the quality of formal and
informal presentations.

Non-matriculated Students
êê
Students wishing to take a course at Stevens on a non-matriculated basis must obtain approval from the Office of Graduate
Academics. A minimum 3.0 GPA at the student’s current or previous college or university is required, in addition to completion
of the equivalent of all pre-requisite courses for the desired Stevens course. Tuition is charged on a per-credit basis. For details
regarding course offerings, visit the Office of the Registrar’s web site at http://www.stevens.edu/directory/office-registrar.

Academic Leave of Absence/Withdrawal from Stevens
êê
Students seeking a Leave of Absence or Withdrawal should appear in person to the Office of Graduate Academics located
in Edwin A. Stevens Building Room 130. Withdrawing from Stevens means that the student no longer plans to continue
his/her education at Stevens. Leave of Absence (LOA) means that the student plans to return to Stevens to continue his/her
education. Students wishing to take a voluntary leave of absence from Stevens can do so for up to one year or two semesters.
Transcripts will be reviewed to determine readmission eligibility and conditions. Students who do not return to Stevens within
one year or two semesters and have not obtained an extension of their Leave of Absence approved by the Dean of Graduate
Academics will be classified as withdrawn with the exception of those in military service who have been deployed.

for tuition and fees. Students must officially withdraw from housing and/or meal plans in writing to the Office of Residence
Life. They will determine the official withdrawal date for housing and meal plans (which may be different than the date
submitted to the Registrar). All tuition, fees, student housing and meal plan charges will be reversed based on the official
withdrawal date and will be calculated from the official opening date of classes in accordance with the following schedules:

Return of Title IV Funds
Federal regulations require specific refund calculations for students receiving Title IV financial aid who completely withdraw
from the University. Under the Return of Title IV (R2T4) regulations, a student is considered to have withdrawn from a
payment period or period of enrollment if he or she does not complete all of the days in the payment period he or she was
scheduled to complete. Title IV financial aid includes the following federal student aid (FSA) programs: Federal Perkins Loan,
Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Pell Grant, Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans and Direct
PLUS/Graduate PLUS loans.
The amount of federal aid a student earns is determined on a prorated basis and is based on the date of withdrawal. Once
a student completes more than 60% of the payment period, all of the federal aid the student is scheduled to receive for
the period is considered as earned. If earned funds are not received prior to the date of withdrawal the student may be due
a post-withdrawal disbursement. Students eligible for post-withdrawal disbursements will be notified – Stevens Institute of
Technology must receive permission from the student before it can disburse these funds. The student will have 14 days from
receipt of notification to accept/decline the post withdrawal disbursement.
Calculations for Return of Title IV Funding are performed as follows:
1.	 Determine the date of withdrawal
2.	 Calculate the percentage of the enrollment period completed as of the date of withdrawal
3.	 Calculate the percentage of Title IV aid the student earned as of the date of withdrawal
4.	 Calculate the amount of Title IV aid that must be returned/repaid to the programs
5.	 Amounts returned to the Department of Education must be credited to the FSA programs in the following order:
a.	 Federal Unsubsidized Loan
b.	 Federal Subsidized Loan
c.	 Federal Perkins Loan
d.	 Federal PLUS Loan
e.	 Federal Pell Grant
f.	 FSEOG
g.	 Other Title IV Grants

TUITION AND FEES
Students who receive Title IV funding and who officially withdraw from the University will be subject to the Return of Title
IV calculation in determining earned aid. Students who receive Title IV funding and stop attending classes without official
notification to the University, whereby a last date of attendance cannot be determined, will be subject to a Return of Title
IV calculation based on attendance through the midpoint of the payment period or the last date of an academically related
activity in which the student participated.
Charges that were previously paid by federal aid funds which are returned per the Return of Title IV policy calculation will be
the responsibility of the student.

Tuition, Fees & Other Expenses for Graduate Students

requests the transcript in writing. Students should allow approximately one week to process the transcript. The transcript is
sent directly by Stevens in a sealed envelope to the requested party. Stevens will only release an official transcript directly
to the student in a sealed envelope. All transcripts are sent by U.S. mail, unless other arrangements are made. If a student
needs the transcripts in less than one week, he/she is required to pay for overnight, two-day, or priority mail. All transcript
requests must be made in writing over the student’s signature or directly from a Stevens email address. No verbal requests for
transcripts will be honored under any circumstances, nor will any requests from a third party unless the student has signed
a release for the transcript to that third party.

Payment Options
Tuition and fees are due and payable by the designated due date sent in the students’ e-bill. Prompt payment of student
account balances ensures students keep the classes they selected and their advance housing selections. Grade reports,
transcripts, and access to registration will be withheld if any balance remains unpaid. Balances paid after the due date will
result in a late payment fee of at least $550.00. Amounts paid with checks returned by the bank will result in additional fees.

Check, e-Check and Credit Card
The Office of Student Accounts accepts check, online e-check and online credit card payments. Payments made by check

authorized third-party payees can make e-check or credit card payments online through ebilling. A non-refundable service
fee of 2.75% (minimum of $3.00) will be added to your credit card payment. Stevens does not charge a fee for e-check
(ACH) payments. You can access ebilling through your myStevens account or directly at www.stevens.edu/ebilling.

Deferred Payments
If a student is not able to pay his/her bill in full at the time of registration, he/she is required to meet with a representative from
The Office of Student Accounts to discuss their payment options. If an employer is assuming responsibility for payment of
tuition and fees following the end of the semester, students may remain registered without payment by selecting the Employer
Reimbursement Bridge Plan Agreement offered in the fall and spring semesters only. There is an additional $150 fee per
semester for selecting this option.

TUITION AND FEES
Monthly Payment Plan
To assist students and their families, Stevens offers a monthly payment plan through Tuition Management Systems (TMS).
This is an interest free option but there is a nominal enrollment fee. You can schedule your payments over as many as five
payments each semester. Stevens allows students who have an active payment plan to attend classes, reside on campus
and participate in other Institute activities while payments are being made to the provider. Enrollment deadline dates apply
so contact TMS for specifics 888-356-0350 or enroll on line at www.afford.com/stevens

Late Payment Fees
Students with unmet financial obligations are not considered to have valid registrations. They are not allowed to attend
classes, receive transcripts or grades, participate in registration, or receive their diploma. If a student withdraws or graduates
from Stevens with a balance due, Stevens will actively try to collect the unpaid balance. This may include referring the
delinquent account to a credit reporting agency and/or collection agency. This may include, but is not limited to, late fees,
collections costs, litigation/attorney’s fees, and court costs.
Balances paid after the due date will result in a late payment fee of at least $550.00 unless the student is enrolled
in the monthly payment plan or a Bridge Plan. Please refer all questions to the Office of Student Accounts by
email studentaccounts@stevens.edu or by phone (201) 216-5555.

Withdrawals and Refunds
Students who enroll and decide not to attend class for any reason must officially drop from classes online at
www.stevens.edu/es/student or by completing the Drop section of the Change of Enrollment form. The Change of Enrollment
form must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar. After the official add/drop period is over a withdrawal will occur and a
“W” grade will appear on the transcript. The professors’ approval and/or the Dean of Graduate or Undergraduate Academics’
approval may be required prior to withdrawing from a class after the add/drop period (please refer to the current Academic
Calendar). The date the form is submitted to the Office of the Registrar will determine the official withdrawal date for tuition
and fees. Students must officially withdraw from housing and/or meal plans in writing to the Office of Residence Life. They
will determine the official withdrawal date for housing and meal plans (which may be different than the date submitted to the
Registrar). All tuition, fees, and student housing and meal plan charges will be reversed based on the official withdrawal date

Financing a Stevens Education
The mission of the Financial Aid staff is to identify financial resources and to provide those resources to students who
would otherwise be unable to pursue their educational and professional goals. The Financial Aid staff strives to facilitate
the financial aid process by educating students and their families about the availability of aid, as well as by providing
solutions and alternatives in educational financing. The staff is committed to ensuring the highest quality of service to Stevens
students. This involves evaluating each student’s aid application individually and the continual assessment of our application,
awarding, and disbursement processes.
Stevens requires the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Incoming undergraduate students must also submit
the CSS PROFILE. The priority filing date for incoming students is February 15th prior to the fall semester in which a student
begins at Stevens; the priority filing date for returning students is April 15 each year. For more information and to complete
the FAFSA online, please visit: www.fafsa.ed.gov. For more information and to complete the CSS/PROFILE, please visit:
https://profileonline.collegeboard.com/prf/index.jsp.
Stevens is committed to making education affordable and we work diligently to provide families with the resources to help.
For families who qualify for financial need, we structure packages around a core of state, federal, and Stevens aid sources,
all of which are considered financial aid components. Independent of need, Stevens also offers merit-based awards to new
students who demonstrate a commitment to excellence through a variety of admission factors, known as “need-blind”
admissions

Undergraduate Student Financial Aid Information
Institutional Financial Aid Programs
êê
Stevens has a strong commitment to assisting and investing in talented students. We offer a wide range of need-based grants
and merit-based scholarships, of which many are made available due to our generous friends and successful alumni. All
institutional merit scholarships received at Stevens are renewable for four years (eight semesters), provided the recipient
meets the predetermined academic requirements stated in the original award notification. Eligibility for renewal is determined
after each spring semester. A student must enroll as a full-time undergraduate (12 credits per semester) in order to receive
any award(s). In no case will the scholarship exceed the tuition cost. Dollar amounts range between $1,000 and full tuition.
Merit scholarships are only awarded at the time of admission after review by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.
Merit scholarships are determined by considering the strength of a student’s application, including academic record and
standardized test scores. Therefore, new merit awards are not available for returning students.
Stevens merit-based scholarships include the following:

The Edwin A. Stevens Scholarship
This award is named in honor of the Institute’s founder. It provides awards to students who have a demonstrated record of
excellence in high school as evidenced by grade point average, class rank, SAT scores and high recommendations.

by high school grade point average, class rank, SAT scores and high recommendations.

The Ann P. Neupauer Scholarship
Stevens’ newest and most prestigious academic honor, named in honor of the late Mrs. Neupauer, a generous friend of the
Institute. The Neupauer Scholarship is a four-year, full tuition award. This scholarship is renewable based on the student
achievement of an annual GPA of 3.2 or better.

ROTC Matching Scholarship
Students who have been selected to receive ROTC Scholarships (of at least $7,500 per semester) while studying at Stevens
will receive an additional supplemental scholarship from the Institute. This additional award will be in the amount of the full
difference between the ROTC Scholarship plus any merit scholarships, and grants, so that all awards combined will equal
full tuition. This award is only available during semesters in which the student is eligible to receive the ROTC Scholarship.

FIRST Scholarship
Admitted students who participated on a FIRST team during their junior or senior year of high school may be eligible for the
FIRST scholarship of $6,000 per year. The scholarship application is available only to incoming freshmen and application
deadlines apply.
Students may also be considered for the following need-based award:

The Stevens Grant
The Stevens Grant is a need-based award that may be offered if a student continues to demonstrate significant financial
need after all other possible sources of grant and scholarship assistance (from Stevens, the U.S. Department of Education,
or the State of NJ) have been applied to his/her financial aid package. The student must be a full-time undergraduate and
eligibility is determined based on the data the student and his/her family supply on the FAFSA. Amounts can fluctuate from
one year to the next if financial circumstances change. The Stevens Grant has no specific grade point average requirement
other than the Institute’s standards for satisfactory academic progress. Students must complete a FAFSA each year by April
15th to confirm their eligibility.

Federal Financial Aid Programs
êê
The federal government offers grant, loan, and work opportunity programs to assist students and their families in meeting the
cost of higher education. Eligibility consideration is determined by information from the FAFSA, a student’s enrollment status
and satisfactory progress toward completion of their degree program.

State of New Jersey Financial Aid Programs
êê
New Jersey residents attending Stevens may qualify for a variety of grants and scholarships offered by the State, mostly
through the New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (NJHESAA). To be considered for state aid, a student
must file the FAFSA no later than June 1 of each year (note that Stevens recommends new students file the FAFSA by
February 15 and the deadline for current students is April 15). No late applications are considered for state awards, and state
awards cannot be used at out-of-state colleges or universities. In addition, they are only available if the student has resided
in New Jersey for at least 12 months as of September 15 of the academic year. If one is considered a dependent student,
his/her parent(s) must also meet the same residency requirement. These are estimated awards set by the state and awards
will be finalized by the state.
Tuition Aid Grant (TAG): TAG is a need-based grant, available to assist low and middle income students. Annual award
amounts range between $1,958 and $12,196. Eligibility is based on the data supplied on the FAFSA and may fluctuate with
the student’s or family’s financial circumstances from one year to the next. TAG is available for a maximum of nine semesters
of undergraduate study. Students must be enrolled full-time in a degree-granting program. However, students in their final
semester who need fewer than 12 credits to fulfill their degree requirements may qualify for TAG during that term with as
few as 6 credits. Students must meet the June 1st yearly TAG deadline in order to be re-awarded for the next academic year.
Educational Opportunity Fund (EOF): New Jersey residents admitted into The Stevens Technical Enrichment Program (STEP)
upon entry into Stevens may also qualify for an Educational Opportunity Fund, or EOF, Grant. This need-based award is in the
amount of $2,500. In order to qualify for this grant and admission into the EOF program, a student (and/or family) must meet
income guidelines established by the State of New Jersey, and the student must also be from an educationally disadvantaged
background.
NJS Governor’s Urban Scholars Program: provides a merit award to high-achieving students who reside in New Jersey’s 14
designated high-need communities. Annual awards of up to $1,000 are available for qualified students. Students must rank
within the top five (5%) percent of their class and have a minimum 3.0 GPA at the end of their junior year of high school and

and non-taxable) must be less than $250,000. In addition, the student must be enrolled full-time, apply for all forms of state
and federal need-based grants and merit scholarships and begin NJ STARS II program participation no later than the second
semester immediately following county college graduation. To be considered for NJ STARS II, students must file a FAFSA
each year within established New Jersey State deadlines.

Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)
êê
The following guidelines apply to all undergraduate students at Stevens, including those seeking financial aid awards from
federal, state, institutional, or other sources administered through Stevens, except in cases where the donor or donors
establish specific requirements.
The student is subject to federal, state, and university limits on the total number of semesters of aid he/she may receive. To
be eligible to receive aid for which he/she qualifies financially, a student must make satisfactory progress toward a degree
as follows:
Progress is routinely monitored at the end of the spring semester after spring semester grades are submitted to
the Registrar’s Office.

Undergraduate Program Guidelines
There are three distinct measurements to the SAP standards:
A. Grade Point Average (Qualitative Measure)
B. Credit Completion Ratio/Pace (Quantitative Measure)
C. Maximum Time Frame measurement
These standards also include an opportunity to appeal the denial of financial aid if the student has faced special circumstances,
which prevented the student from attaining the minimum standards described in this policy. The Satisfactory Academic
Appeals Committee will not automatically reinstate a student’s aid even after a student has been readmitted to the University.
Federal financial aid eligibility does not allow for reinstatement based on academic renewal policies.
A. Grade Point Average (GPA) / (Qualitative Measure)
Undergraduate students must maintain at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA after attempting 12 credits. Stevens Institute
of Technology requires at least a 2.0 GPA for conferral of the bachelor’s degree. Specific federal, state and
institutional scholarships and grants may require a different GPA for renewal; this is a separate requirement for
continued eligibility for these funds.
B. Credit Completion Ratio or Calculating Pace (Quantitative Measure)
Each year, a student’s progress will be measured by comparing the number of attempted credit hours with the
earned credit hours. This includes any course for which the student has remained enrolled past the add/drop
period. After a student has attempted 12 credits, s/he must earn sixty seven percent (67%) of the cumulative
attempted credits to maintain satisfactory academic progress.
C. Maximum Time Frame Measure
A student is eligible to receive funding up to 150% attempted credit hours toward their degree. Some programs limit
funding on a semester basis. Students that attempt and earn only the minimum amount of credit hours required
may run out of eligibility for certain federal and state financial aid programs prior to completing their degree.

General Information
A. Withdrawal from courses /WD (Withdrawn officially)
Credits remain in the total number of attempted hours but are not added to the earned credits. This may have a
negative effect on the total number of earned credits needed per year. The GPA is not affected by these grades.
B. Incomplete courses/ INC (Incomplete)
These courses will be counted when determining the number of credits attempted. When a passing grade is
received, the grade will be added to the number of credits earned.
C. Repeated courses
These courses are counted each time the course is taken and will be included in the total number of attempted
credit hours. When a course is completed, the credits are added to the total number of earned credits hours.
D. Transfer credits
Transfer credits, accepted by Stevens, will be added to the attempted/earned credit hours in order to determine the
number of credits a student should attempt and earn.
E. Failing Grades
These grades may have a serious negative impact on the student’s academic record: F (Failing), and M (Missing,
no grade submitted)
F. Expunged Grades
Expunged Grades are included in the financial aid SAP calculation. Federal regulations do not allow for Academic
Amnesty; therefore Expunged grades cannot be excluded from evaluation. This means that the GPA that appears
on a student’s academic transcript will be different than the GPA used in the financial aid SAP calculation.
Students identified as not making SAP will receive correspondence at their campus e-mail address. Students have the right
to appeal the decision by submitting a SAP Appeal Form. Generally, the SAP Appeals Committee will consider appeals that
involve circumstances beyond the student’s control that have had an impact upon the student’s academic performance.
The appeal must include a narrative of the extenuating circumstances (e.g., the student or an immediate family member
suffered a serious illness or injury, death of a close relative, separation or divorce) that prevented the student from meeting
the minimum requirements, and reasonable explanation of the expectation that the event/circumstances will not re-occur.
Students are required to attach pertinent documentation supporting their appeal including their Appeal Letter and at least one
piece of objective documentation. Furthermore, students who do not meet SAP after their financial aid probation semester

Graduate Student Financial Information
Financial Aid Sources
êê
Many sources of financial aid are available to graduate students. These include fellowships, assistantships, on-campus
employment, employer tuition assistance plans, loan funds, and deferred payment plans. Fellowships and assistantships
are granted on a competitive basis to outstanding full-time graduate students. Applicants should consult their department
for more information regarding assistantships. Continuing students may become eligible for additional sources of aid as they
progress through the program and should consult with their department at regular intervals.
Click here for more information.

Graduate Assistantships
Graduate Assistantships (teaching, research, or other) are available in every academic department and in some non-academic
departments. Graduate Assistants are appointed based on recommendation by the appropriate department director or
principal investigator of a grant or contract. Graduate Assistants may carry a reduced course load but still complete the
master’s degree in two years or less.
Stevens Institute of Technology is able to offer a select group of students funding in the form of teaching or research
assistantships. The material provided and discussed in this section is for information purposes only, and is offered as a guide.
Assistantships are graduate funding opportunities that can take many forms. A student awarded a research or teaching
assistantship may receive tuition and fees for up to three courses per semester during the Fall and Spring semester plus a
stipend; or some combination of tuition, fees, and stipend. In exchange for the predetermined funding, the student must
work up to a maximum of 20 hours per week during the semester, and maintain a satisfactory academic performance.
Stevens does not provide what is commonly known as “tuition waivers”; for example, the tuition and fee costs cannot be
waived. Additional support may also be available for the summer sessions.

FINANCIAL AID
The number of assistantships awarded each year is limited. If you do not receive an assistantship for your first year at
Stevens you can pursue an assistantship within your department after you arrive. It is important to note that each department
identifies and awards assistantships to students, while the Registrar’s Office administers the process.

Provost Masters Fellowship Awards
The Provost Masters Fellowships are offered each year during the fall and spring semesters to exceptional students interested
in pursuing a master’s degree on a full-time basis. These one-time fellowships are awarded to qualified students at the time
of their admission to any one of the Master’s degree programs offered at Stevens. Students who are placed approximately
in the top 5% of the applicant pool are considered for this award. Selection criteria for the Provost Masters Fellowship
includes GRE/GMAT scores in addition to exceptional undergraduate academic performance. TOEFL/IELTS scores are also
considered as a criterion for international applicants. There is no separate application for the fellowship awards as students
are automatically considered when they initially apply.

Research Assistantships
Research Assistantships generally provide graduate tuition and fee support and a monthly stipend (see above) for services
on sponsored research contracts. Appointments are reviewed and made by the Office of Graduate Admissions after
recommendation by the academic department director or principal investigator.

Teaching Assistantships
Teaching Assistantships generally provide graduate tuition and fee support and a monthly stipend (see above) for
teaching assistant services in the academic departments. Appointments are reviewed and made by the Dean of Academic
Administration after recommendation by the academic department director.

Robert Crooks Stanley Graduate Fellowships
Robert Crooks Stanley Graduate Fellowships provide tuition plus living allowance for graduate students pursuing a Ph.D.
degree. The fellowships are endowed through the generosity of the late Mrs. Robert C. Stanley and her children as a
memorial to Dr. Stanley, Class of 1899 and former chairman of the Board of Trustees. A committee appointed by the Board
of Trustees makes the selections.

Loans and Work-Study
Graduate students enrolled in a degree-granting program on at least a half-time basis (a minimum of six credits per semester)
may apply for federal student loans and/or Federal Work-Study by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA). The results of this standardized application will allow the Office of Financial Aid to determine eligibility for federal
aid. Only U.S. citizens or permanent residents may file the FAFSA; international students do not qualify for federal assistance.

FAFSA
The FAFSA should be completed and submitted to the processing center at least eight weeks prior to the beginning of
the semester in which the student plans to enroll. The FAFSA may be submitted online atwww.fafsa.ed.gov. Additional

$138,500. Interest accrues on the loan beginning at disbursement (the interest rate is fixed and is 6.21% for the 2014-15
year) and there is a loan fee taken at the time of disbursement 1.073%).
The Graduate PLUS loan is a credit-based loan that is not need based. The interest rate is fixed at 7.21% for the 2014-2015
year. The Graduate PLUS Application can be completed at studentloans.gov. After submission of the PLUS Application,
the student will receive a credit decision electronically. If credit approved then the student must complete their Graduate
PLUS Promissory Note, on studentloans.gov. If your credit is declined by the federal government then you may appeal their
credit decision, or you may wish to obtain a co-signer. A co-signer must electronically complete an Endorser Addendum on
www.studentloans.gov.

Private Education Loans
Alternative Loans (Private Education Loans) are offered through private lenders and are meant to provide additional
educational funding only after a student and his/her family has exhausted all other sources of funding such as federal and
state aid. These loans are not guaranteed by the federal government and may carry high interest rates and origination fees.
All of the loans require a credit check and most will require a cosigner if the borrower has little or negative credit history.
Stevens is not permitted to recommend any specific lender/programs. Contact the lender of your choice for details about
their program and application process. Make sure to understand your rights, responsibilities and benefits before you select a
lender. A list of historical lenders may be found at www.stevens.edu/sit/financial-aid/student-info/afo.

Academic Integrity
Honor System for Undergraduate Students
êê
The Stevens Honor System is the rigorous ethical and moral standard to which undergraduate students are held, and which
seeks to ensure that all academic work is bona fide. This standard was formally established in 1908 with the creation of
the Stevens Honor System as well as its governing body, the Stevens Honor Board. The Honor System at Stevens fulfills two
objectives. First, it seeks to ensure that work submitted by students can be trusted as their own and was performed in an
atmosphere of honesty and fair play. Second, it promotes a sense of honor and integrity throughout campus and for Stevens’
students in preparation for the professional world.
Enrollment into the undergraduate student body at Stevens Institute of Technology signifies a student’s commitment to the
Honor System and the University’s ethical and moral standards. It is the responsibility of each student to become acquainted
with and to uphold the ideals set forth in the Honor System Constitution. Specific student responsibilities include:
Maintaining honesty and fair play in all aspects of academic life at Stevens
Writing and signing the pledge, in full, on all submitted academic work
Reporting any suspected violations to the Honor Board
Cooperating with the Honor Board during investigations and hearings
Student responsibilities are further outlined in the constitution and bylaws of the Honor System, which may be reviewed
online at www.stevens.edu/honor.
The Honor Board is the Honor System’s governing body. It is comprised of undergraduate students who are elected by
their peers. Members of the Honor Board investigate all suspected breaches of academic integrity, and assign penalties to
students who either confess to or are found responsible for Honor System violations. When investigating a case, Honor Board
members meet with the accused student, pertinent witnesses, and relevant faculty. The investigation culminates with one
of three outcomes: the case is dropped due to insufficient evidence to support the suspected violation, the accused student
confesses, or a hearing is held and the case is presented to a jury of the student’s peers.
The Honor System also includes a two-level appeals process. Any student who is dissatisfied with the penalty assigned by
the Honor Board after confessing or being found responsible by a jury may appeal to the Academic Appeals Committee for a
reduced penalty. If unsuccessful, the student may submit a final appeal to the Provost or appointed designee.

Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity
êê
The Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity holds that integrity is essential to the ethical pursuit of knowledge and
is expected of all Stevens graduate students in all academic endeavors including coursework, research, scholarship, and
creative activity.
While all members of the Stevens Community have a responsibility to uphold and maintain the highest standards of integrity
in study, research, instruction, and evaluation, the Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity is concerned specifically
with the conduct of graduate students.
By enrollment at Stevens, all graduate students promise to be fully truthful and avoid dishonesty, fraud, misrepresentation,
and deceit of any type in relation to their academic work. A student’s submission of work for academic credit indicates that

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

65

UNIVERSITY POLICIES
the work is the student’s own. All outside assistance must be acknowledged. Any student who violates this code or who
knowingly assists another student in violating this code shall be subject to discipline.
Individual departments or schools within the Institute may adopt additional policies and procedures above and beyond those
set forth in this code, but any and all purported violations must be reported to the Office of Graduate Academics no more
than seven business days after the instructor becomes aware of the issue.
For more information on the Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity, including types of violations, the process for
handling perceived violations and the types of sanctions that can be applied, please visit http://www.stevens.edu/sites/

Undergraduate Programs
BACHELOR OF ENGINEERING
The Stevens engineering curriculum is rooted in a tradition that has set it apart since the founding of the Institute in 1870, yet
it remains responsive to the changing demands of the workplace into which one graduates. The Stevens tradition recognizes
the value of a broad core curriculum that provides significant breadth in engineering, the sciences, and the humanities,
combined with the necessary depth in your chosen engineering discipline.
To meet these goals, the Charles V. Schaefer, Jr. School of Engineering and Science offers a demanding curriculum. It
prepares you technically and instills a work ethic that has proven of considerable value to our graduates throughout their lives.
In addition to strong technical competencies in general engineering and the specific discipline, the curriculum teaches key
competencies that are highly valued by employers. These include strong problem-solving skills, effective team-participation
skills, and the ability to communicate effectively, in both written and oral modes.
A major vehicle for achieving these competencies in the engineering curriculum is the Design Spine. The Design Spine is
a sequence of design courses each semester; initially it is integrated with science and engineering core courses and, in
future semesters, the discipline-specific program. Design is at the heart of engineering. Design activities allow you to gain
confidence in applying and reinforcing the knowledge learned in the classroom.
As an engineering student, you take core courses for the first three semesters. The choice of the engineering discipline in
which you will concentrate is made late in the third semester. You are provided many opportunities to explore the various
engineering fields.

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

71

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
You may choose to specialize in biomedical, chemical, civil, computer, electrical, environmental, or mechanical engineering,
as well as engineering management. A program in engineering is also available which presently has a concentration in
naval engineering.
A strength of the Stevens engineering curriculum is the requirement for a significant thread of humanities and general
education courses throughout the four-year program. You may take advantage of this as a platform to pursue a minor or to
pursue the double degree program, a B.A. degree in addition to the B.E. degree.
The following pages outline the structure of the engineering curriculum by semester, showing core course and technical
elective requirements. Specific concentrations are described by the department, as are requirements for their minor programs.

Engineering Program
The B.E. in Engineering is founded on the strength of the extensive Stevens core curriculum in exposing students to a
breadth of engineering topics while allowing for concentration in an engineering area. In this regard it allows for a somewhat
more flexible program than is typically available in a specialized B.E. program. At present, a concentration is offered in Naval
Engineering. Several technical electives within the program can be tailored to a student’s interests under the guidance of the
program faculty advisor.
Concentration in Naval Engineering
Naval Engineering is a broad-based engineering discipline that involves the design, construction, operation, and maintenance
of surface and sub-surface ships, ocean structures, and shore facilities. Although these vessels and facilities are traditionally
employed in the defense of the nation, many are also employed in the support of the civilian (commercial) Marine
Transportation System. Because of the complexities of today’s naval and civilian vessels and supporting infrastructure, the
naval engineer must possess a strong background in the physical sciences, mathematics, and modeling, as well as the more
specialized fields of naval architecture, marine engineering, systems engineering, and environmental engineering.
Mission and Objectives
The mission of the engineering program with a concentration in naval engineering program at Stevens is to develop innovative
engineers capable of international leadership in the profession. The educational program emphasizes design innovation,
trans-disciplinary study, a systems perspective on complex ship and infrastructure designs, lifelong learning and opportunities
for international study and internships. As is the case for the other Stevens engineering programs, the naval engineering
program includes a broad-based core engineering curriculum and a substantial experience in the humanities.
The program is conducted in concert with the Stevens leadership in the Office of Naval Research–sponsored Atlantic Center
for the Innovative Design and Control of Small Ships and in collaboration with University College London.
The objectives of the engineering with a concentration in naval engineering program are provided in terms of our expectations
for our graduates. Within several years of graduation, they will:
Be recognized as among the most innovative designers and project managers in the world;
Be thoroughly aware of, and knowledgeable in dealing with, environmental, social, ethical, and economic impacts
of their projects; Augment their knowledge through professional and cultural continuing education; and
Be active in leadership roles within their professional and technical societies.

Guidelines for Engineering Minor Programs
A minor represents a coherent program of study in an engineering discipline other than the student’s major degree program.
Successful completion of a minor program is recognized on the transcript and with a Minor Certificate at graduation.
Recognition is thus provided for a significant education experience in another discipline.

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

72

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
General guidelines for a minor program in an engineering discipline are:
Engineering minor programs will consist of a coherent sequence of a minimum of six courses. A minimum of
two courses (minimum 6 credits) should be in addition to those courses required to complete a student’s major
degree program (which includes general education courses).
The minor program must be in a discipline other than that of a student’s major program of study. As such minors
are distinguished from options within the major discipline or the concentration within the Engineering Program
(typically referred to as the general engineering program)
The Minor Advisor may allow courses awarded transfer credit to be used but these must constitute less than half
of those applied to the minor program.
A student may earn no more than two Engineering minors.
A student wishing to pursue a minor program must complete a Minor Program Study Plan signed by a Minor
Advisor from the discipline of the minor to ensure a coherent program is undertaken. In order to be awarded the
minor at graduation the student must complete a Minor Candidacy Form signed by the Minor Advisor after all
minor requirements are fulfilled.
Entry to an Engineering minor program requires the student to have a minimum GPA of 2.5. In order for a course to count
towards a minor the grade of C or above must be achieved.

Minor in Entrepreneurship
The undergraduate minor in entrepreneurship provides the educational prerequisites needed to foster the successful birth
and development of technology-driven new ventures.
The minor will provide the knowledge and the infrastructure needed to sustain and support the efforts of Stevens’
undergraduate students in engineering and science to create economic value through innovation and entrepreneurship.
After completing the minor, students will be able to develop and write an effective business plan by systematically developing
the following skills:
Able to identify and recognize viable technical business opportunities
Can critically evaluate these business opportunities
Can assess and manage the intellectual property embodied in technological opportunities
Can develop an effective business model addressing market, operating and financial requirements
Knows how to launch a technologically-based business

Minor in Green Engineering
Issues of sustainability are of increasing concern for the developed and the developing nations of the world. Engineers have
to take a central role in providing the needed solutions and associated leadership to address those issues. In the design,
implementation and use of products, processes and systems that impact all facets of our lives, fundamental decisions are
made by engineers. Those decisions can either contribute to an exacerbation of the negative impact of human endeavors
on the environment, or they can be the means to reduce that impact. Engineering decisions are not just technical; they
essentially must include economic considerations as well as be influenced by the ethical, social and political dimensions that
shape their context.
The application of the principles by which engineers can have a positive impact on sustainability is known as Sustainable
Engineering or more colloquially as Green Engineering. The latter terminology has found resonance with the general
resurgence of interest in the environmental impact of human activity and the associated “green” approaches to mitigating
them. While elements of sustainable engineering are permeating the broad-based Stevens undergraduate engineering
programs, the scope is relatively limited so far. It is therefore proposed that for the student who wishes to explore sustainable
approaches to engineering in some depth, the appropriate vehicle is to pursue a minor program.

Objectives of the Green Engineering Minor
Provide a holistic, systems perspective to the impact of human activity on the environment, including the role of
engineering.
Educate students in the concepts of sustainable development and industrial ecology.
Provide insight into sustainability tools and metrics such as life cycle analysis and ecological footprint.
Show how engineering decisions, particular with regard to design, can support sustainability goals.
Develop awareness of the ethical, economic, social and political dimensions that influence sustainability.

Content of the Green Engineering Minor
The Green Engineering Minor consists of six courses, three of which are required. It provides a two-course foundation. This is
followed by two technical electives which can also provide a sustainable engineering focus area. Two additional courses are
intended to allow students to explore ethical, social, economic and political contextual issues associated with sustainability.
It should be noted that some of the courses taken towards the minor might also be applicable to meet Humanities/Social

BACHELOR OF SCIENCE
The science departments—Biomedical Engineering, Chemistry & Biological Sciences, Computer Science, Mathematical
Sciences and Physics & Engineering Physics—provide exciting, top-quality programs for undergraduates at Stevens. The
quality of our programs derives from the quality of our world-class faculty. Undergraduate students are a welcomed part of
our community. They are afforded ready access to faculty and to ongoing research activities on campus and off campus, and,
as they pursue their studies, undergraduates are encouraged to participate in research and innovative and entrepreneurial
activities.
The science curricula at Stevens emphasize project-based learning, encourage and reward independent study and scientific
initiative, offer expanded research opportunities for undergraduates, and promote the undergraduate thesis as a capstone
for a student’s course of study. These elements of the curriculum are intended to enhance the undergraduate experience of
the student with a serious interest in studying the natural sciences or computer science.
The undergraduate programs are separated into two categories of curricula. The programs in chemistry & chemical biology,
mathematical sciences, and physics follow a unified curriculum, the Bachelor of Science in the natural sciences. The
Department of Computer Science has developed distinct curricula for each of two undergraduate programs: Bachelor of
Science in Computer Science, and Bachelor of Science in Natural Science Subjects.
The science program at Stevens offers a remarkable opportunity for a career in today’s scientific world. It prepares you to work
at the frontiers of knowledge making significant contributions to science and the well-being of mankind. Careers in biology,
chemistry, medicine, physics, nanotechnology, mathematics, and statistics, are accessible through the science program.
The concepts, techniques and attitudes that are common to all sciences form the core courses of the Science program.
You develop an awareness of the interactions among the various scientific disciplines and their individual contributions to
the advancement of knowledge - the total picture of science. Additional courses in a chosen concentration prepare you
exceptionally well with both the tools and knowledge to enter a profession immediately upon graduation, or to embark on
advanced study leading to a graduate degree.
Studies during your freshman year include courses in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics,
and a sequence of courses in humanities. Studies in the humanities continue throughout the four-year program. In the next
three years you may choose a concentration in the area of chemistry, chemical biology, mathematics, computational science,

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
applied physics, or engineering physics. Upon successful completion of your studies, you are awarded the Bachelor of
Science degree.
The minimal formal requirements for the science program are listed in the semester-by-semester schedule, including the Notes.
Courses may be taken in a different order than listed. Consult the individual department schedule for more specific details.

Bachelor of Science (Computer Science)
The computer science degree emphasizes the principles of computer science and prepares students for careers in industry and/
or graduate school. Course materials focus on how to design, implement, deploy, and manage sophisticated software systems.

Bachelor of Science (Cybersecurity)
As the need for data security increases in all industries, including medicine, banking, and homeland security, the demand
for professionals with knowledge in the areas of information assurance and computer security continues to grow. In 2003, as
part of the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, the White House identified as a top priority the necessity of maintaining
a pool of well-trained and certified IT security specialists through providing comprehensive training and education.
The cybersecurity major builds on a basic computer science education to also develop the deep technical skills required of a
modern security professional. These skills include a deep knowledge and understanding of crytography, as well as the ability
to diagnose threats and defenses for software systems. Therefore the pivot course for this major is a course in secure systems
that includes a cybersecurity lab as a co-requisite. The cybersecurity major include courses in:
Operating systems
Concurrent programming
Database management systems
Cybersecurity fundamentals
Privacy
Cryptography
Secure systems
This program is structured to provide students with security expertise within the context of a broad education. The curriculum
not only has a strong focus in science and computer science but also incorporates aspects of engineering and technology
management. Cybersecurity students in the senior design project do a project involving secure systems, under the guidance
and supervision of security faculty.

Minor in Entrepreneurship
The undergraduate minor in entrepreneurship provides the educational prerequisites needed to foster the successful birth
and development of technology-driven new ventures.
The minor will provide the knowledge and the infrastructure needed to sustain and support the efforts of Stevens’
undergraduate students in engineering and science to create economic value through innovation and entrepreneurship.
After completing the minor, students will be able to develop and write an effective business plan by systematically developing
the following skills:
Able to identify and recognize viable technical business opportunities
Can critically evaluate these business opportunities
Can assess and manage the intellectual property embodied in technological opportunities

UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS
Chemistry
Chemistry is a field of study which seeks to describe the properties, composition, structure and process of formation of all
things that make up the universe. Chemistry, which is commonly known as the central science, bridges the gap between the
life sciences and physical sciences.
The Stevens Chemistry program is based on a solid foundation in the major core areas of chemistry which includes organic
chemistry, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry and biochemistry. Additional courses in advanced
chemistry are available in those areas in which Stevens has unique strengths, such as polymer chemistry, natural products,
medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, and instrumental analysis. Research is strongly encouraged due to its
importance in preparing for a career in chemistry; it also helps develop independence in solving open-ended problems.
The Stevens program prepares students for career opportunities in diverse fields including pharmaceuticals, petroleum, polymers
and plastics, paints and adhesives, electronic materials, waste treatment, agricultural chemistry, and foods and fragrances, in
addition to many other industries. Chemists can be involved in research where they either create new knowledge or synthesize
new chemicals. They can also choose fields in quality control where testing and analysis are crucial. Chemists are employed in
hospitals, as well as clinical, environmental control, and criminology laboratories. Chemistry also occupies a pivotal role in the
high-technology areas of bioinformatics, biotechnology, materials technology, ceramics, polymers, and electronic materials. The
Stevens program also prepares students for success in graduate programs in chemistry and professional schools.
The Bachelor of Science in Chemistry is certified by the American Chemical Society (ACS).

Chemical Biology
Chemical Biology is the application of chemistry to the understanding and utilization of biological phenomena. Chemical
biology represents an approach to understanding biology through the underlying chemical interactions of biological
macromolecules and provides students with the essential tools to reveal the logic of how biological systems operate as well
as engineering changes in those systems. Stevens pioneered this field with establishing the first undergraduate program in
chemical biology in the late 1970s.
By developing a chemical understanding of biological systems, chemical biologists can develop quantitative descriptions of
complex biological phenomena, predict outcomes of biological systems, and contribute to the new field of synthetic biology
wherein the chemistry of life is expanded using existing scientific principles that nature has not yet employed.
The Stevens Program in Chemical Biology combines a complete education in chemistry with additional mathematics and
physics training to ensure a solid foundation in quantitative physical sciences and a set of biology courses that introduce the
key elements of cellular, molecular, and physiological biology. Thus, the chemical biology program is effective in launching
students onto careers in chemistry, biochemistry, biotechnology, forensic science or biology. This program also allows students
to prepare for further training at the Masters or PhD level in a wide array of programs in chemical or biological sciences as
well as gain the training necessary for admission in professional schools in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine or other
health professions.

Bioinformatics
New and powerful techniques have been developed for determining the structures of biological molecules and manipulating
biomolecular sequences which results in large amounts of data. Bioinformatics makes use of mathematical and computer
science techniques to process this data so it can be used for further scientific advances. The Stevens Bioinformatics track is
built on the foundations of chemical biology. Students elect CS115 as an introduction to computing in the freshman year in
place of CS105. After the first two years in the Chemical Biology Program, the Bioinformatics student begins replacing certain
electives with mathematics and computer science courses. The Stevens Bioinformatics track concentrates on giving students
the ability to contribute to building the software and analytical infrastructure of the field.

Bioanalytical Chemistry
Biological systems are characterized by presence of large, complex biological molecules arrayed as collections of genes,
transcripts, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and associated metabolites. Whereas a comprehensive chemical definition of
biological systems was once beyond the realm of possibility, we can now envision the treatment of biological cells, tissues,
and even complete organisms in terms of their chemical composition and interactions. Bioanalytical chemistry comprises
the techniques and instrumentation necessary to separate and analyze the chemical composition of biological systems.
Bioanalytical chemists have already made tremendous contributions in the areas of genomics, gene expression analysis,
and disease gene/protein identification, as well as drug discovery and forensic science. In addition to further contributions
in these fields, bioanalytical chemists will be increasingly needed to improve the practice of medicine through chemicallydefined diseases states, and to protect our general public through surveillance for illicit drugs, explosives, and pathogens.
The track in bioanalytical chemistry is built on the foundations of chemical biology. After the first two years in the regular
chemical biology program, the bioanalytical chemistry student begins concentrating on analytical techniques relevant to
biological macromolecules such as mass spectrometry, magnetic resonance imaging, flow cytometry, and genome and
transcriptome array analysis.

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
Biology
Stevens recently instituted a new major in biology. The biology program reflects Stevens’ philosophy that life sciences are
best approached with a strong foundation in chemical and physical sciences. As a result, the Biology and Chemical Biology
Programs share the same curriculum through three semesters. The principle difference between the programs relates to
the amount of chemistry required in the advance undergraduate curriculum. In the biology major, additional upper level
courses are dedicated to expanding the breadth and depth of exposure to biology topics and additional technical and general
electives encourage pairing of the biology curriculum with the pursuit of minor fields of study, graduate certificates, double
majors or master’s degrees in other disciplines. Like the chemical biology curriculum, the biology curriculum will provide
students with a strong background in chemistry, physics and mathematics that will ensure that students will have the ability
to understand and engineer life science systems.
Graduates of the biology program at Stevens will be well prepared to pursue employment in biomedical science, biotechnology,
or clinical research laboratories, to continue their education at the master’s or doctoral level in a wide array of programs in
biological sciences, to gain admission to professional training in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, physician assistant,
physical therapy, or other health professions, or to combine their knowledge of life sciences with employment in other areas
of employment such as scientific publishing, law, business, or healthcare.

Accelerated Program in Medicine
If you are pursuing the special combined degree program in medicine, your undergraduate curriculum will include core
courses common to both the Chemical Biology and Biology Programs. The completion of this core within three years at
Stevens requires adoption of a heavy course load, and a minimum GPA and score on the Medical College Admissions Test
(MCAT) to ensure matriculation to the professional training program. The first year of the medical program transfers as credit
for completion of the B.S. degree, so the undergraduate degree is awarded after four years. Enrolling in the Accelerated
Program in Medicine requires admission to both Stevens and the professional school at the time of the initial undergraduate
application. Please see information on Undergraduate Admissions for more information.

Biomedical Engineering
The Bachelor of Engineering program in Biomedical Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission
(EAC) of ABET.
A Biomedical Engineer works at the interface between physical and biological systems. A distinguishing feature of biomedical
engineers is that they design instruments and devices that interact with or make measurements on living systems. These
systems can be as small as a protein, gene, or cell, as complex as an organ such as the heart and lungs or as integrated as
the heart lungs and muscles during exercise. The ultimate goal is to help improve medical diagnosis and treatment and to
improve the quality of life for people who are incapacitated.
The biomedical engineering field is truly multidisciplinary. Biomedical engineers must understand not only basic engineering
principles but also the biology and physiology of cells, organs and systems that work together to create a functioning human
being. In addition, the biomedical engineer must have some in-depth experience in applying engineering concepts to living
systems. Biomedical Engineers are engaged in designing and manufacturing prostheses (replacement hips, knees, tendons,
arms, legs, etc.), total artificial hearts as well as left ventricular assist devices, pacemakers and defibrillators, Imaging devices
such as CAT scans, MRI, f-MRI, ultrasound, and nuclear medicine imaging (PET,SPECT), replacement organs (artificial
pancreas, ears, retina, etc.), in-patient monitoring devices (blood pressure, sleep apnea, EKG, etc.), in addition to more
standard medical devices such as portable EKG and pulmonary function machines for use in physicians’ offices. Biomedical
Engineers also engage in cutting edge research on living systems and contribute important new knowledge to the field.

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
The Biomedical Engineering program at Stevens is based on a solid foundation in basic science, math, biology and engineering
fundamentals. Within Biomedical Engineering, there is depth in these two areas:
Biomechanics & Biomaterials
E344 Materials Processing
BME 505 Biomaterials
BME 506 Biomechanics
BME 556 Advanced Biomechanics
Bioinstrumentation
E232 Engineering Design IV
E322 Engineering Design VI
BME 460: Biomedical Digital Signal Processing Laboratory
BME 504: Medical Instrumentation & Imaging
In addition, courses in Transport in Biosystems, Engineering Physiology, Biosystems Simulation and Control, and Bioethics
are included to provide the multidisciplinary background for a modern biomedical engineer. The transport, physiology,
biomaterials, imaging and simulation courses contain laboratories to provide extensive hands-on experience. Since tomorrow’s
biomedical devices will have to be smarter, smaller and, in many cases wireless, a course in bioinstrumentation design is
included in the design sequence (Design VI). The program is design oriented and culminates in a group capstone senior
design project that spans the 7th and 8th semesters. The group carries out a comprehensive design of a biomedical device
which includes an economic analysis, engineering computations and drawings, a plan for manufacture and the delivery of a
working prototype of the device or a major component of the device. The emphasis in the design sequence is on teamwork,
presentation skills and an entrepreneurial approach to design and manufacture. The program also provides for the flexibility
of applying to medical school. The courses required to take the MCAT exam are normally completed by the end of the junior
year.

Biomedical Engineering Program Mission and Objectives
The Stevens biomedical engineering program produces graduates who possess a broad foundation in engineering and
liberal arts, combined with a depth of disciplinary knowledge at the interface of engineering and biology. This knowledge is
mandatory for success in a biomedical engineering career. Biomedical engineering is also an enabling step for a career in
medicine, dentistry, business or law.
The objectives of the biomedical engineering program are to prepare students such that within several years after graduation:
Graduates will identify biomedical engineering challenges and lead solution concepts using their knowledge of
fundamental engineering principles, work experience and state-of-the-art tools and techniques.
Graduates will be among the leaders of the fields in development of biomedical devices, implants, tissues, and
systems to meet the needs of society.
Graduates will establish themselves as leaders in their chosen career path by applying their skills in problem
solving, teamwork, ethics, management, communication, and their awareness of professional and social issues.

In lieu of the 9-credit thesis, students can elect to do a 6-credit research or design project, plus 3 credits of additional
graduate course work in connection with their job. The project must be approved by the BME program director and have the
official support of the students company. Wherever possible, research and design projects will include an outside member of
the thesis committee from the medical or biotech industry.

Core Courses in Biomedical Engineering - Common Requirements for Students with BME/other Engineering background.
(Prerequisites may be required)
Students may be admitted to the M.Eng. program in BME with undergraduate engineering degrees other than BME. For
students admitted with a non-BME degree, prerequisite courses may be required that may not carry graduate credit. The
prerequisite courses will be determined on an individual basis in consultation with the BME graduate program advisor. In any
case, all graduate BME students are required to complete the following core courses:
BME 600 Strategies and Principles of Biomedical Design
BME 601 LA Advanced Biomedical Engineering Lab

Doctoral Programs in Chemistry and in Chemical Biology
There are two different doctoral programs, a Doctorate in Philosophy in Chemistry and a Doctorate in Philosophy in Chemical
Biology. The master’s degree is not a prerequisite for admission to the doctoral program. Admission to either doctoral program
is based on official transcripts showing strong performance in chemistry or chemistry and biology coursework, GRE scores,
letters of recommendation from at least three of more people who know the student’s academic and research background
and for applicants whose native language is not English, a minimum score as specified by the Office of Graduate Academics
on the TOEFL. The admissions committee is looking for reasonable evidence that the student will be successful and prove
capable of specialization with a broad intellectual foundation. Specifically, students will be admitted to the doctoral program
only if the Admissions Committee feels that he/she is reasonably well prepared for the Qualifying Examinations in Chemistry

111

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
or Chemical Biology, which must be passed within a 15-month period after admission. Students who enter the PhD Program
after a master’s degree in the field should be prepared to take the Qualifying Exam within 10 months. Applicants with good
academic records who lack this level of preparation may be admitted initially to the M.S. program.
Continuation in the doctoral program is contingent on passing the Qualifying Examination, Preliminary Examination, and
meeting all other requirements as dictated by the Stevens Office of Graduate Academics. A student enrolled in the master’s
program in Chemistry or Chemical Biology who is interested in a doctorate degree must apply formally for admission to the
Doctoral program. For the Ph.D. degree, a prior Masters’ degree may be transferred for up to 30 credits. Up to one-third of
additional course credits may be transferred with the approval of the Program Director and the Dean of the Graduate School
provided they have not been used to obtain another degree.

Electives
To complete the course requirements for the degree, a student may choose additional courses with the approval of the
advisor. Special courses are frequently offered under the title of Special (or Selected) Topics, which can be included with the
permission of the advisor. Some courses are offered as reading courses, with no designated lecture schedule.

Degree Requirements
All doctoral students in Chemistry and Chemical Biology must pass a Qualifying Examination. After successful completion
of the qualifying examination, the next milestone is a preliminary examination. The preliminary examination is based on an
original research proposal in an area of the student’s own choice, preferably an area related to the pending dissertation area
but with a topic significantly different from his or her thesis. It is submitted in written form and defended orally before the
Thesis Committee. The final milestone is the doctoral dissertation and defense. Specifics on these degree requirements can
be found in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology Program Graduate Student Handbook.

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

113

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
Language Proficiency
Students must fulfill the English proficiency requirements on page 44.
Doctoral Dissertation
The policies and regulations governing the doctoral dissertation are described in detail in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology
Program Graduate Student Handbook.

Doctoral Program in Biomedical Engineering
The purpose of the doctoral program is to educate scientists and engineers who are prepared to carry out independent
investigations. While courses provide the tools for independent work, a large part of the doctoral work is done through
independent study. This includes preparation for the qualifying examination, the preparation of research proposals and
seminars and familiarity with the current scientific literature in the area of specialization.
The master’s degree is not a prerequisite for admission to the doctoral program. Admission to the doctoral program is based
on 1) GRE score, and 2) reasonable evidence that the student will prove capable of specialization on a broad intellectual
foundation. 84 credits of graduate work in an approved program of study are required beyond the bachelor’s degree. This may
include up to 30 credits obtained in a master’s degree program, if the area of the master’s degree is relevant to the doctoral
program. Those with a master’s degree who wish to transfer credits towards the Ph.D. must be aware that only one master’s
degree can be used toward the Ph.D. A doctoral dissertation based on the results of original research, carried out under the
guidance of a faculty member and defended in public examination, is a major component of the doctoral program, and is
included in the 84-credit requirement. For more details about program requirements, see our Graduate Student Handbook.
In the BME program, between 30 and 45 credits may be earned for the Ph.D. dissertation.

Graduate Certificate Programs
In addition to the degree programs, the department currently offers “mini-graduate” programs leading to the Certificate of
Special Study in one of seven areas: Analytical Chemistry, Biomedical Chemistry, Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Biology,
Chemical Physiology, Laboratory Methods in Chemical Biology and Polymer Chemistry. Students in these certificate programs
must meet the same admission and performance standards as regular degree graduate students. Each of the certificate
programs requires twelve credits (four courses), all of which are transferable to the appropriate master’s degree program.

UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS
Chemical Engineering
A distinguishing responsibility of chemical engineers is that they create, design, and improve processes and products that
are vital to our society. Today’s high technology areas of biomedicine, electronic device processing, ceramics, plastics, and
other high-performance materials are generating opportunities for innovative solutions that may be provided by the unique
background chemical engineers possess.
Generally considered to be one of the most diverse fields of engineering, the opportunities afforded chemical engineers are
equally diverse: research and development, design, manufacturing, marketing and management. A variety of industries are
served by chemical engineers, including: energy, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, food, agricultural products, polymers and

plastics, materials, semiconductor processing, waste treatment, environmental monitoring and improvement, and many
others. There are career opportunities in traditional chemical engineering fields like energy and petrochemicals, but also in
biochemical, pharmaceutical, biomedical, electrochemical, materials, and environmental engineering.
The chemical engineering program at Stevens is based on the fundamental areas of chemical engineering science that are
common to all of its branches. Courses in organic and physical chemistry, biochemical engineering and process control
are offered in addition to chemical engineering core courses in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer,
separations, process analysis, reactor design, and process design. Thus, the chemical engineering graduate is equipped
for the many challenges facing modern engineering professionals. Chemical engineering courses include significant use of
modern computational tools and computer simulation programs. Qualified undergraduates may also work with faculty on
research projects. Many of our graduates pursue advanced study in chemical engineering, bioengineering or biomedical
engineering, medicine, law, and many other fields.

Mission and Objectives
The following mission statement lays out our primary goal in the education of future chemical engineers:

“The chemical engineering program educates technological leaders by preparing them for
the conception, synthesis, design, testing, scale-up, operation, control and optimization of
industrial chemical processes that impact our well-being.”
As an indicator of our readiness for accomplishing this objective, our program has been accredited by the Accreditation Board
for Engineering and Technology (ABET), which is recognized as the worldwide leader in assuring quality and stimulating
innovation in applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology education.
The Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) of the Chemical Engineering Program indicate expectations from our
graduates a few years after graduation. The program faculty in collaboration with the School of Engineering’s Education and
Assessment Committee (SEAC), the CEMS department’s External Advisory Board, and alumni developed these objectives.

The Civil, Environmental and Ocean Engineering Department promotes the use of engineering approaches to create solutions
for societal needs concerning the built and natural environment by
providing a high quality, broad-based undergraduate education that emphasizes both fundamental knowledge
and design experiences for its students;
developing new knowledge through cutting-edge and applied research; providing services and leadership to the
public and the profession;
integrating research knowledge and professional service experience into innovative undergraduate and graduate
instruction;
and by fostering in our students a culture of lifelong personal and professional growth.

UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS
The department has three programs towards the degree of bachelor of engineering (B.E.): civil engineering, environmental
engineering, and engineering (with a concentration in naval engineering). These programs are accredited by Engineering
Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET (http://www.abet.org). In addition, there are several minors offered to engineering
students in other majors. The individual B.E. programs are described below.

B.E. in Civil Engineering
Civil engineering is concerned with the design and construction of infrastructure, including structures, foundations,
environmental and transportation systems, waterways, ports, irrigation, storm water and green infrastructure, and water
supply and treatment. The civil engineer’s vital role is to plan, design, and supervise the construction of these facilities.
Civil engineering is one of the most publicly visible technical fields. It has the distinction of being one of the earliest of the
engineering disciplines, yet continues to generate new technology. The basic principles of structural analysis, which are the
concern of civil engineers, are expressed in every machine and aircraft, and in buildings and other constructed facilities.
The study of mechanics is basic to the field of civil engineering. Water is fundamental to all life. Civil engineers design water
systems with applications ranging from urban water supply to aquatic ecosystem protection. A thorough foundation in
science and mathematics is necessary for the application of basic scientific principles to the design of structures and fluid
systems. Computer methods are integrated throughout the civil engineering elective offerings. Graduates of the Stevens
program meet the demands for positions of responsibility in various sub-disciplines of civil engineering and contribute to the
advancement of the civil engineering practice. Prospective employers include industrial firms, consulting engineering firms,
and construction contractors, as well as various government agencies. Our undergraduate offerings include subjects basic
to all civil engineering.

Civil Engineering Program Mission and Objectives
The mission of the civil engineering program at Stevens is to educate a new generation of civil engineers who are leaders
in the profession. The educational program emphasizes technical competence, professional practice, leadership, lifelong
learning, civic contribution and entrepreneurship.

and in business engineering management, with specialization in civil engineering. Within the sequence of civil engineering
courses, students have the flexibility to concentrate in structural, transportation, geotechnical, water resources, environmental
engineering, and construction management.
The objectives of the civil engineering program are provided in terms of our expectations for our graduates. Within several
years of graduation:
Our graduates apply mathematics and science to solve complex problems in civil engineering.
Our graduates apply skills in problem solving, teamwork, ethics, management, communication, and awareness
of professional and social issues to establish leadership in their chosen career paths.

B.E. in Environmental Engineering
Environmental engineering has traditionally been taught as a branch of civil engineering concerned with the supply of safe
drinking water and the sanitary disposal of municipal wastes. The field has expanded in recent years to include many new
areas, such as the treatment of industrial and hazardous wastes, the prediction of the fate and transport of pollutants in
the environment, and the design of systems for remediation of sites contaminated with hazardous wastes. Furthermore, the
field continues to grow into new directions such as sustainability and green engineering. These changes have placed new
demands on engineers to understand the fundamental environmental transformation processes that describe natural and
engineered systems for which this program is designed to prepare our students.

Environmental Engineering Program Mission and Objectives
The mission of the environmental engineering program is to provide a broad-based education that prepares students in the
technical and social fundamentals that will enable them to have a wide impact in the improvement of interactions between
humans and their environment.

B.E. in Engineering (Concentration in Naval Engineering)
The naval engineering concentration within the engineering program is a broad-based discipline that involves the design,
construction, operation, and maintenance of surface and subsurface ships, ocean structures, and shore facilities. Although
these vessels and facilities are traditionally employed in the defense of the nation, many are also employed in the support
of the civilian (commercial) Marine Transportation System. Because of the complexities of today’s naval and civilian vessels
and supporting infrastructure, the naval engineer must possess a strong background in the physical sciences, mathematics,
and modeling, as well as the more specialized fields of naval architecture, marine engineering, systems engineering, and
environmental engineering.

Engineering Program Mission and Objectives
The mission of the engineering program with a concentration in naval engineering at Stevens is to develop innovative
engineers capable of international leadership in the profession. The educational program emphasizes design innovation,
trans-disciplinary study, a systems perspective on complex ship and infrastructure designs, lifelong learning, and opportunities
for international study and internships. As is the case for the other Stevens engineering programs, the engineering program
includes a broad-based core engineering curriculum and a substantial experience in the humanities.
The program is conducted in concert with the Stevens leadership in the Office of Naval Research-sponsored Atlantic Center
for the Innovative Design and Control of Small Ships and in collaboration with University College London.
The objectives of the engineering program are provided in terms of our expectations for our graduates. Within several years
of graduation, they will
Graduates of the engineering program will be recognized as being among “the best in the business” by their peers
in technical disciplines that engineering graduates are engaged in. They will leverage their broad engineering
background to continuously expand their areas of expertise.
Graduates of our program will professionally enhance their workplace through multidisciplinary collaboration,
teamwork and leadership.
Graduates of our program will maintain exemplary sensitivity to social factors including the environmental, historical,
legal, political, policy, economic, ethical and public relations aspects of problems in various engineering disciplines.

Master of Engineering - Environmental Engineering
The Environmental Engineering graduate program is divided into three areas of concentration: Environmental Control
Processes, Groundwater and Soil Pollution Control, and Environmental System Modeling.
The Environmental Processes concentration addresses the treatment of industrial and domestic water and wastewater, and
hazardous wastes. Process fundamentals are integrated with a design-based approach to meeting treatment objectives.
Students will be prepared for careers in both design and operation of facilities for pollution control. Graduates of this
program are best qualified for design and operation work in public and private treatment facilities such as for drinking water,
wastewater, and industrial wastes.
The Groundwater and Soil Pollution Control concentration emphasizes the transport and fate of contaminants in the
subsurface environment and on engineering processes to mitigate their adverse environmental impact. Some specific areas
of study in this option are the modeling of contaminant transport in local or regional geohydrologic systems, the impact
of contamination in the subsurface environment, the management of municipal and industrial waste disposal, and the
remediation of groundwater and soil. Many of our graduates in this option work in remediation of contaminated properties or
of groundwater resources.
The Modeling of Environmental Systems concentration addresses the circulation and mixing processes in surface waters
and the effect of such processes on the fate and transport of contaminants. Deterministic, stochastic, and experimental
techniques are emphasized. Major areas of current faculty research include groundwater hydrology and pollution, water
and wastewater treatment processes, design of waste disposal management, and environmental processes in coastal and
estuarine waters. This option is appropriate for those interested in a more analytical approach to environmental processes
in nature, and has career interests in conducting studies of pollutant fate and transport in the environment, or who have an
interest in a research or academic career.
Master’s candidates without a previous engineering degree may, on a case-by-case basis, be allowed to enroll for the Master
of Engineering in Environmental Engineering if they have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant science discipline. These students
may be required to take additional engineering courses, including undergraduate courses, not for credit towards a degree.
All applicants must have at least two years of calculus and one year of chemistry.

As a professional, the Construction Manager has evolved as the leader responsible for coordinating the resources necessary
for successful completion of a high quality project, on-time and within budget expectations. The Construction Manager must
master the skills of leadership, project controls, and digital-proficiency beyond estimating and scheduling software. The
industry also demands inquiry into this age-old profession so that mega projects, infrastructure renewal, and urban resiliency
can be planned and delivered with confidence.
The program is designed to focus on the complex mega project and allows students to select courses from the Schools
of Systems and Enterprises, Technology Management and Arts and Letters. An undergraduate degree in Architecture,
Construction Management, Engineering or related disciplines from a recognized school is a prerequisite for graduate study
in construction management. Applicants not meeting this prerequisite will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may be
required to enroll in CM 510 (Construction Management Fundamentals) course if accepted.
Stevens offers a Master of Science degree and several Graduate Certificates in Construction Management. The successful
degree graduate will complete five core courses for 15 credits and an additional 15 credits from graduate-level courses within
Construction Management or pre-approved courses offered institute-wide.

MINOR IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
You may qualify for a minor in computer science by taking the courses indicated below. Enrollment in a minor means you
must meet the Institute’s requirements for minor programs. As many as four of the six courses may be double-counted
toward both your minor and your major, assuming that your major accepts those four courses. Only courses completed with
grade of C or better are accepted towards a student’s minor.
The minor includes these four courses:
CS 115 Introduction to Computer Science
CS 135 Discrete Structures or MA 134 Discrete Mathematics
CS 284 Data Structures
CS 385 Algorithms
plus any two CS courses numbered 300 or higher; these courses must each be 3 or more credits. No course may duplicate
another; specifically, students may not count toward the minor CS 501, CS 570, or CS 590; also, students may not count
toward the minor both courses in each of the following pairs: CS 383 and CS 550, CS 492 and CS 520, CS 496 and CS 510,
CS 442 and CS 561.
The Computer Science minor is available to Cybersecurity majors. Cybersecurity students minoring in computer science must
take two CS courses numbered 300 or higher that are not already applied toward the requirements of the Cybersecurity degree.

BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN CYBERSECURITY
The Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity program is structured to provide students with security expertise within the context
of a broad education. A solid education in security requires not only a strong focus in science and computer science
in particular (e.g., need for robust implementation and software validation), but must also incorporate some aspects of
engineering and technology management. While cryptographers strive to develop the best security solution possible, actual
implementations of theoretical concepts often fail due to technological limitations, cost restraints, and human factors that
were not part of the initial design process. For a solution to gain practical relevance, the end user must be able and willing
to use it. From an economical point of view, a solution must provide a substantial monetary benefit to the customer. In order
to allow for these complex issues to be better addressed, an education in cybersecurity must integrate science, technology,
and management.

Cybersecurity Requirements
The program requires the following courses:

Mathematics
MA 121 Differential Calculus
MA 122 Integral Calculus
MA 123 Series, Vectors, Functions, and Surfaces
MA 124 Calculus for Functions of Two Variables
CS 135 Discrete Structures

PREREQUISITE DIAGRAMS
The figure below shows prerequisite and corequisite relationships among required undergraduate courses. A dashed line
indicates a corequisite. For example, the dashed line from CS 135 to CS 284 means that a student taking CS 284 must either
have already passed CS 135 or be taking it at the same time as CS 284. (All numbers refer to CS courses.)

Graduate Programs
The Computer Science Department offers four master’s degrees, several graduate certificates, an engineer degree, and a
doctoral degree.
Master of Science in Computer Science: The MS/CS is the flagship graduate program. It is designed to be flexible
in allowing students to combine several areas of concentration, such as software engineering, cybersecurity,
and databases and service-oriented architecture. Ph.D. students who do not already have a M.S. degree should
consider pursuing a M.S. in Computer Science to develop breadth before their Ph.D. studies.

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

218

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
Master of Science in Enterprise and Cloud Computing: The MS/ECC is intended to educate high-end IT professionals
with an interest in enterprise computing. Students learn about distributed computing from both the reliability and
security points of view, including service-oriented architecture (SOA). This program has a particular emphasis
on systems administration and governance. A typical back-end setup will involve several virtualized servers,
running heterogeneous guest operating systems on top of hypervisors, organized in a highly available cluster.
Data processing and Web service applications will have service level agreements (SLAs) that must be honored.
This program develops the skills sets for the professionals who administer such operations.
Master of Science in Cybersecurity: The MS/CyS is a rigorous program in the art and practice of cybersecurity,
including fundamentals of cryptography, and threats and defenses for secure systems. The emphasis in this
program is on deep technical skills that may be complemented with courses in security management, in addition
to the security courses suggested for the MS/CS which emphasize broad principles and security administration.
Master of Engineering in Media and Broadcast Engineering: Media and broadcast engineering lies at the
intersection of audio/video processing, networking, software design, and complex system integration. The Master
of Science in Media and Broadcast Engineering provides students with a comprehensive foundation in all aspects
of media production, delivery, and management, and prepares them for relevant careers as media and broadcast
engineers, network managers and developers, streaming media developers, and project managers for broadcast
networks. It provides similar education and opportunities to professionals in the field who wish to enhance their
skillsets. It also covers media engineering in emerging media publishing channels such as through the Internet
and mobile applications.
Graduate Certificate: A graduate certificate typically consists of four graduate courses in a targeted area of study.
The courses for a graduate certificate also may be used towards another graduate degree, such as a master’s
degree.
Engineer in Computer Science: The degree of Engineer in Computer Science is for students who already have a
Master degree in computer science or a closely related field and who wish to continue to study computer science
deeply at an advanced level, but who do not wish to or cannot make the time commitment necessary for the
PhD degree. The degree requires 30 credits of computer science beyond the MS degree. Nine to twelve of these
credits must be for a single long-term project on an advanced computer science topic (course CS 950).
Ph.D. in Computer Science: The doctoral degree is a program of full time on-campus study only, aimed at preparing
the student for a career in computer science research.

Master of Science - Enterprise and Cloud Computing
The MS/ECC program is intended to educate high-end IT professionals with an interest in enterprise and cloud computing.
Cloud computing has revolutionized the management of information technology (IT) resources by businesses and enterprises,
providing greater scalability and manageability over traditional approaches, but introducing serious challenges with respect
to security and privacy. Cloud computing typically involves software applications deployed as software-as-a-service (SaaS)
over utility computing services such as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS). The program
covers enterprise software architectures and applications, such as service-oriented architecture and REST, as well as other
application architectures such as server push, streaming, and peer-to-peer. Cloud-based computing platforms such as
Hadoop, and NoSQL data stores such as Amazon Dynamo and Cassandra, are also considered. Theoretical underpinnings
such as eventual consistency and distributed agreement, and tools such as vector time and Paxos, as also considered,
Security and privacy aspects of cloud computing are covered from first principles, such as the use of public key infrastructures
for secure Web services. The program also considers the integration of cloud computing services with mobile applications,
where the cloud provides a ubiquitous compute and storage infrastructure for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Students of this program will gain hands-on experience with managing resources and deploying applications on cloud
computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Windows Azure. They will develop Web applications using
frameworks such as ASP.NET MVC and Java Server Faces, as well as Web services using Java and C#, and enterprise-level
mobile applications using Android. Graduates of the program will be able to take a lead role in their organization in decisionmaking regarding moving applications into the cloud, and integrating with the existing enterprise infrastructure. They will
also, by benefit of their hands-on experience with the program, be in a position to lead development efforts with respect to
cloud-based, Web and mobile applications.

Degree Requirements
1.	 Completion of at least thirty credit-hours of study at the graduate level (500-level and above), with a minimum
grade of C and a minimum GPA of 3.00.

Master of Science - Cybersecurity
Reports of cybersecurity breaches have become a fixed presence in news headlines. The theft of customer account data from
large retailers such as Target (2013), Staples (2014), Michaels (2014), The Home Depot (2014), and of information about
government employees and contractors from the computer systems of federal offices (2015), continues to inconvenience
millions of people every year. Internet pandemics such as those caused by the Code Red (2001), Sobig.F (2003), MyDoom
(2004) and Conficker (2008) worms have cost several billion dollars to the global economy in recent years. Conservative
estimates by security experts are that millions of residential computers are “zombies” (or “bots”) taken over by attackers
unbeknownst to their owners, organized into “bot-nets,” and used routinely for spamming everyone that uses the Internet.
Denial of service attacks have been staged against major corporations that rely on network access, such as eBay (2000)
and PayPal (2010), as well as against the root servers for the internet Domain Naming System (DNS), using bot-nets
whose “services” can be purchased on the black market for just a few hundred dollars. Criminal gangs are hiring expert
programmers to break into law enforcement databases to learn the names of informants. Consumers are becoming more
and more reliant on computer systems, even for sensitive activities like home banking, while companies and governments
are exposing themselves to potential attacks due to the need to establish and maintain a “Web presence.” On the legislative
level, increasing privacy concerns are giving rise to legislation of which companies must be aware and to which they must
be able to adapt.
In response to these trends, Stevens has developed a graduate program in cybersecurity that provides deep and rigorous
training in cybersecurity to IT professionals who already have a background in computer science, computer engineering, or
other closely related discipline in the information sciences. The program aims to provide a nationally recognized credential for
cybersecurity professionals. Academically inclined graduates of this program will also be well poised to pursue Ph.D. study in
cybersecurity, should they so choose. The program provides a rigorous education in the foundations of security and privacy,
including cryptography and secure systems.

Degree Requirements
Completion of at least thirty credit-hours of study at the graduate level (500-level and above), with a minimum grade of C and
a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.00. The seven core courses listed below must be completed.
Beyond the core courses listed below, students may choose from a list of approved electives posted on the department web site.

Graduate Certificate Programs
The Computer Science department offers graduate certificate programs to students meeting the regular admission
requirements for the master’s program. Each certificate program is self-contained and highly focused, comprising 12 or
more credits. Courses taken for a Graduate Certificate may also be used toward a master’s degree.

Databases
This program provides a firm grounding in enterprise architecture, particularly as supported by modern database management
systems and platforms such as Web services. Students may also focus on data mining, including both algorithms and
applications of existing data mining tools.
CS 561 Database Management Systems I
CS 562 Database Management Systems II
CS 546 Web Programming
CS 574 Object-Oriented Analysis and Design or CS 513 Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining

Cybersecurity
Students will obtain a deep technical background in security and privacy, particularly in the cryptographic foundations of
the tools that the security specialist will need to use. They will know that cryptographic tools require a deep understanding
of their properties to be deployed properly, rather than simply treated as black boxes. They will obtain a background in
algorithm design and implementation, and discrete mathematics for cryptography, prior to learning about the most popular
cryptographic algorithms and protocols. They will also learn about both the technical and the social aspects of privacy, where
legislation is still grappling with how to resolve individuals’ privacy rights with the immense benefits to be gained from vast
on-line information resources, and where technical solutions can inform the legal and social debate.

Enterprise Security and Information Assurance
This program is for students interested in security and privacy, particularly as it pertains to businesses, governments, and
other forms of enterprises. They will get a basic grounding in security concepts, including the various forms of threats and
defenses. Students will learn how enterprises can protect against attacks and exploits both from inside and outside the
organization, including ensuring that critical data survives such attacks. Security governance is an important part of such
mechanisms. They will learn how to recover from a security attack, determining the cause and sometimes the source of the
exploit. Finally, students will also learn about both the technical and the social aspects of privacy, where legislation is still
grappling with how to resolve individuals’ privacy rights with the immense benefits to be gained from vast on-line information
resources, and where technical solutions can inform the legal and social debate.

Service-Oriented Computing
This program is for students who are working in an existing domain where they see the growing use of and need for IT skills.
The program provides an accelerated professional education program that provides them with the skill sets that they need in
order to use and manage the IT that is being deployed globally today. Students may have little or no background in software
development, but they want to be a professional in a particular field with IT skills. This program will provide students with very
focused training in the skill sets that are required to make them technically capable of taking existing frameworks and using
them to develop new client-specific applications. The focus of the program is very much on front-end skills:
Requirements acquisition and analysis
Human-computer interaction
Web design and information architecture
Ethical and privacy issues
The kinds of tasks that students will pursue will range all the way from designing and implementing web pages, to developing
distributed collaborative applications with sophisticated database back-ends using frameworks, such as Websphere and .NET.

Systems and Cloud Computing or CS 526 Enterprise and Cloud Computing

Enterprise and Cloud Computing
This program is for students who want to become high-end IT professionals with an interest in enterprise computing. Students
will learn about distributed computing from both the reliability and the security points of view. They will learn about distributed
computing “in the large,” including enterprise application integration and service-oriented architectures (SOA). They will
build on skills learned in courses in operating systems, databases, and systems programming for enterprise computing, to
learn how to administer server back-ends that are the crux of modern SOA. This will involve ensuring that applications meet
their goals in terms of performance, reliability, security, and privacy. A typical backend setup will involve several virtualized
servers, running heterogeneous guest operating systems on top of hypervisors, organized in a highly available cluster. Data
processing and Web service applications will have service level agreements (SLAs) that must be honored. The administrator
must be able to respond to performance issues by dynamically reallocating resources between applications, while at the
same time responding to component failures, and potentially also security attacks.

Health Informatics
Students of this program will learn to use data mining methods to derive, in an exploratory manner, valuable healthcare
knowledge in terms of associations, sequential patterns, classifications, predictions and symbolic rules. They will be able to
describe and use tools for preserving the privacy of confidential data, as well as explain some of the social and legal aspects
of privacy. Students will be able to explain health care IT standards such as UDEF and HL7, explain health care terminology,
and perform system selection and evaluation in the areas of telemedicine, dental informatics, consumer health informatics,

Engineer Degree
The degree of Engineer in Computer Science is for students who already have a Masters degree in computer science or a
closely related field and who wish to continue to study computer science deeply at an advanced level, but who do not wish
to or cannot make the time commitment necessary for the PhD degree. The degree requires 30 credits of computer science
beyond the MS degree. Nine to 12 of these credits must be for a single long term project on an advanced computer science
topic (course CS 950). For part time students, the project topic cannot be drawn from the student’s activity. The project must
be work beyond the student’s job activity, so as to expand the student’s sphere of expertise. The student must be advised at
all times by a full time Computer Science department faculty member. The advisor must approve and supervise the project.
The project must be described in a substantial document that is reviewed by a committee of faculty, presented in a public
defense, and submitted to the library for archival publication.

Doctoral Program
The purpose of the Ph.D. program is to educate students for a career in computer science research. The goal is for the quality
of Stevens graduates to be on par with those produced by the best Computer Science departments in the country.

Full-time study
To make progress on leading-edge subjects in a fast moving field like computer science requires full-time study. It is nearly
impossible to do work that is important, timely, and novel at the pace afforded by part-time effort-either one’s result will be
“scooped” or conditions will change within the field, rendering the work no longer current. Accordingly, Ph.D. students will
be admitted only for full-time on-campus study.

Advised study
Each doctoral student must at all times have a single advisor who is a tenured or tenure-track Stevens faculty member. The
relationship between advisor and student is not merely an administrative one. Starting early in his/her career, the student will
work on research projects to be determined by the advisor and student. Through this day-to-day interaction, the student will
learn the form and content of high quality research. The student’s advisor will also guide the student through the program,
e.g., advising on such matters as which courses to take, when to attempt the qualifying exam, what dissertation topic to
pursue, etc.

Advisor-advisee relationship
The department aims to admit only students whose background and interests match those of the faculty. Each admitted
student will be assigned an advisor whose expertise is well matched to the student. It is hoped that most students will remain
with their initial advisors throughout their career, performing research with him/her. However, the advisor-advisee relationship
is a voluntary one. If either the student or the faculty member becomes dissatisfied with the relationship, then the student

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

228

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
must seek another advisor among the faculty. A student can change advisors at any time provided that the student’s new
advisor is willing to accept the student.

Requirements
The Ph.D. degree requires 84 credits beyond the bachelor’s degree. Students who already possess a master’s degree may be
granted up to 30 credits. The 84 credits may be fulfilled by some combination of: prior MS degree, enrollment in classroom
courses, and enrollment in research participation (course CS 960). The division of a student’s effort between classroom
courses and research participation will vary from case to case, and is a decision that should be made by the student in
consultation with and with the approval of the student’s advisor. There is no minimum number of classroom courses for the
doctorate.

Progress review
Each student’s progress is reviewed by the entire computer science faculty near the end of the fall and spring semesters.
Preparatory to this review, the student must submit a brief progress report describing the student’s progress since the last
review, as well as his/her plans for the time up to the next review. After drafting the report, the student must submit it to his/
her advisor for approval. Once approved, the report must be submitted to the Computer Science department office.
Students who are doctoral “candidates” must also submit a second, separate, report to the Dean of Graduate Academics’
office. The definition of the term “candidate” is left to each department, and the Computer Science department defines
candidates to be students who have passed the qualifying exam, both written and oral parts. The report for the graduate
dean must be submitted on a special form-the “Doctoral Activity Report,” (DAR). It is acceptable to write a single report and
submit the DAR to the department, as well as to the graduate office.
The outcome of the progress review meeting is that a student is placed into one of three categories: good standing, probation,
or terminated. A student in good standing is making satisfactory progress toward his/her degree, and is expected to follow
through on the plans outlined in his/her progress report. A student on probation is making inadequate progress toward his/
her degree. A student on probation will receive a letter from the faculty that explains what remedial actions he/she must take
to return to good standing, and by what time each action must be taken. No student will be terminated without spending at
least the preceding semester on probation.

Qualifying Exam
Each student must pass the qualifying exam early in his/her career. The exam has two purposes: to certify that the student
is broadly educated in key areas of computer science and to demonstrate that the student has become acquainted with the
process of performing original research.
Accordingly, the qualifying exam has two parts, written and oral. The written portion of the qualifying exam tests the student’s
knowledge of fundamental computer science at an elementary level, akin to that achieved in a bachelor’s program. The
written exam tests three subjects: algorithms, programming languages, and operating systems. A student must pass all three
subjects in order to pass the written exam. The exam is offered near the end of fall and spring semesters, timed so that grades
are available at the progress review meeting. A student may take the written exam at most twice. Any subjects passed the first
time need not be taken the second time. The written exam should be taken during the student’s first two semesters in the
program. The written exam must be completely passed during the student’s first four semesters in the program.
The purpose of the oral portion of the qualifying exam is for the student to demonstrate promise in doing independent original
research. The student will perform some work as specified by, and under the supervision of, his/her advisor. Ideally, this work
would consist of the actual production of publishable research results; however, depending on circumstances, it may be
more appropriate for the student to perform some type of pre-research work. The student will write a report detailing his/her
effort and accomplishments. The student will give a public, announced talk detailing his/her effort and accomplishments.
The paper will be read, and the talk attended, by the student’s advisor and two other pre-selected regular Stevens faculty
Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

229

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
members. These three faculty will decide whether the student has passed the oral exam. In style, the report and the talk
must be similar to research presentations given by experienced researchers. If either the report or the talk is judged to be
inadequate in either content or presentation, this fact will be taken into account during the faculty’s evaluation of the student
that semester. The student may be terminated, placed on probation, required to prepare a new report or talk, perform further
research, or some other remedial action(s).
The oral qualifying exam must be passed no more than 12 months after passage of the written qualifying exam, or by the end
of student’s 5th semester in the program, whichever is earlier.

Thesis proposal
To demonstrate that he/she is ready to undertake dissertation research, the student must write and present a thesis proposal.
The written document must describe the proposed research so that an appropriately informed computer scientist-although
not necessarily someone who is an expert in the topic-can understand the proposal. The written proposal should contain
an explanation of the problem and why it is important, a sketch of the proposed solution, and background information that
serves to indicate that the problem is unsolved and what prior or related approaches to this or similar problems have already
been investigated. After writing the document, the student must make a public presentation of the proposed work. The
document must be read-and the presentation should be attended-by the persons who are expected to form the student’s
dissertation defense committee. The presentation must allow reasonable time for appropriate questions by any person in
attendance. After the presentation, the dissertation committee will decide whether the student’s proposal indicates that he/
she is ready to do the proposed work successfully.
If the proposal is judged to be inadequate in either content or presentation, this fact will be taken into account during the
faculty’s evaluation of the student that semester. The student may be terminated, placed on probation, required to prepare a
new talk, perform further research, or some other remedial action(s).

Dissertation defense
The department follows the Stevens-wide procedures for the dissertation defense, including committee composition.

Required rate of progress
Stevens imposes certain deadlines on the student:
Students who have a master’s degree must complete the doctoral degree within six years.
The thesis proposal must be presented at least 12 months before the degree is awarded.
It is “recommended” that the qualifying exam be attempted no more than one year after entry to the program or
after receipt of the master’s degree, whichever comes first.
In addition, a certain rate of progress through the program is typical and expected:
••The written qualifying exam should be attempted in the first two semesters.
••The written qualifying exam must be passed by the end of the fourth semester.
••The oral qualifying exam must be passed by the end of the fifth semester (or no more than 12 months
after passage of the written exam, whichever is earlier).
••The thesis proposal should be presented by the end of the sixth semester.
••These are only guidelines: meeting all these targets does not necessarily constitute satisfactory progress,
nor does failing to meet any necessarily constitute unsatisfactory progress.

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
Leave
It is expected that students, once enrolled in the doctoral program, will remain enrolled full-time without interruption until
graduation. However, sometimes it is necessary for a student to take a leave for a reason, such as personal difficulty, health,
etc. If such a situation arises, the student must petition the faculty in writing for a leave, which, if granted, will last for one
semester. To extend the leave, a new petition must be filed. Neither indefinite leave nor excessive repetition of leave is
permitted. While the student is on leave, any time limit he/she faces (e.g., completing the qualifying exam within two years)
is suspended for the length of the leave.

Exceptions
The faculty reserve the right to make exceptions to any of the rules and procedures described above in order to promote and
preserve the health of the doctoral program and to ensure each student’s prompt and effective progress through the program.

UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS
Electrical Engineering
Today’s technological world is driven by the electronics and electronic systems, developed and advanced by electrical
engineers that are found embedded in a large portion of today’s commercial and consumer products. The electronic
systems and subsystems (including both hardware and software components) are increasing exponentially in complexity
and sophistication each year. The familiar expectation that next year’s computer and communications products will be far
more powerful than today’s is common to all products incorporating electronics. The high (and increasing) complexity and
sophistication of these electronic products may not be seen by the casual user, but they are understood, delivered, and
advanced by electrical engineers. The field of electrical engineering encompasses areas such as telecommunications, data
networks, signal processing, digital systems, embedded computing, intelligent systems, electronics, optoelectronics, solid
state devices, and many others. The Department’s program is designed to provide our electrical engineering graduates with
the tools and skills necessary to understand and apply today’s technologies and to become leaders in developing tomorrow’s
technologies and applications.
The principles and practices of electrical engineering rest upon the broad base of fundamental science and mathematics
that defines the School of Engineering and Science’s core program. A sequence of electrical engineering courses provides
students with an understanding of the major themes defining contemporary electronic systems, as well as depth in the
mathematics and principles of today’s complex electronic systems. Students select elective courses to develop depth in areas
of personal interest. In addition to electrical engineering elective courses, students can draw upon computer engineering
and other Stevens courses to develop the skills appropriate for their career objectives. In the senior year, students complete
a significant, team-based engineering design project through which they further develop their skills.

Mission and Objectives
The mission of the undergraduate electrical engineering program in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
(ECE) is to provide a balanced education in fundamental principles, design methodologies, and practical experiences
in electrical engineering and in general engineering topics through which graduates can enter into and sustain lifelong
professional careers of innovation and creativity.
The overriding objective of the electrical engineering program is to provide graduates with the skills and understanding
needed to design and build innovative new products and services which balance the rival requirements of competitive
performance/cost and practical constraints imposed by available technologies.
Graduates of the Electrical Engineering program will:
Understand the evolving electronic devices and systems from their underlying physical principles and properties.
Design electronic devices, circuits, and systems by applying underlying mathematical principles, software
principles, and engineering models.
Perform effectively in team-based electronic engineering practice.
Be proficient in the systematic explorations of alternatives for electronic systems design.
Demonstrate compliance with professional ethics, for example, as stipulated in the IEEE Code of Ethics.
Be proficient in the use of communications (oral presentations and written reports) to articulate their ideas
effectively.
Participate in continuing learning and self-improvement necessary for a productive career in computer engineering.
Play leadership roles in their professions.

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
Humanities Requirement
All undergraduate students are required to fulfill certain Humanities requirements in order to graduate. Please see pages
556-557 for a breakdown of specific requirements by program.
English Language Proficiency
All students must satisfy an English Language proficiency requirement.
Electives
“Technical electives” are generally selected from among the courses (EE or CPE) listed among the ECE course descriptions.
Under special circumstances, students may be allowed to use courses from other departments to satisfy the technical
elective requirement. Approval by the course instructor, the student’s advisor, and the ECE Director is required.
“General Electives” are free electives, and can be selected from among any courses (including ECE courses) at Stevens
Institute of Technology. Students can use 500-level ECE courses to satisfy an elective requirement, with the permission of the
course instructor and the students’ advisor. If a student satisfies the conditions established by the Stevens Graduate School
for admission into 600-level graduate courses, ECE 600-level courses may also be used as electives or technical electives.
Students interested in using a 500-level or 600-level course from other departments as a free elective must satisfy the
conditions for admission into the course by the offering department.

Engineering with a Concentration in Information Systems Engineering
The SSE and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) of the Charles V. Schaefer, Jr. School of Engineering
and Science jointly offer an Information Systems Engineering (ISE) concentration under the Engineering Program in the
undergraduate curriculum.
The goal of the ISE concentration is to produce graduates with a broad engineering foundation who can be effective in the
analysis, design, construction, implementation, and management of information systems. A student can choose either a
focus area in information systems management or networked information systems (NIS). Students taking the NIS focus will,
in general, take their senior design sequence with students in the Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering (CPE)
program. Whereas, those students taking the ISM focus will take their senior design sequence with students in the Bachelor
of Engineering in Engineering Management (BEEM) program. The following lists typical electives within each focus. Other
appropriate electives can be chosen with the approval of a faculty advisor.

Network Information Systems (NIS)
Electives for the NIS focus can be selected from any ECE undergraduate or 500-level courses consistent with the themes of
networks, information, and networked information systems. When appropriate, courses from other academic programs can
also be used, with a maximum of 2 courses from other academic programs. The Director of the ECE Department serves as
advisor to students in this focus area and electives must be approved by the ECE Director.

Information Systems Management (ISM)
Rapid advancements in technology and dynamic markets and the changing business environment have created increased
demand for professionals who can manage and deliver information systems. This demand has been accelerated by new
competition, shorter product life cycles, and more complex and specialized markets.

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
The mission of the Bachelor of Engineering in ISE (BEISE) Program is to provide an education based on a strong engineering
core, complemented by studies in business, computer engineering, systems, and management, to provide systems
professionals who can develop, lead, and evolve information resources partnering with corporate management. ISE graduates
are prepared to work at the interface between engineering and management to design and build innovative new products
and services which balance the rival requirements of competitive performance/cost and practical constraints imposed by
available technologies.
The objectives of the BEISE program can be summarized as follows:
ISE graduates have a strong general engineering foundation and are able to use modern technological tools while
working on complex multidisciplinary problems.
ISE graduates will have assumed leadership positions in their chosen areas of work using knowledge gained from
their information systems education.
ISE graduates effectively work in teams on projects to solve real-world problems. This effort can involve information
research, the use of project management tools and techniques, and the economic justification of the solution that
is effectively communicated in a written or oral project report/business proposal that is presented to the client.
ISE graduates will be proficient in the systematic exploration of the design space to achieve optimized designs.
ISE graduates possess the ethics, knowledge, skills, and attributes to define, design, develop, and manage
resources, processes, and complex systems needed to work in a multidisciplinary team environment.
ISE graduates will apply engineering and management skills and the tools to continue sustained intellectual
growth in the corporate or academic world.

emphasize the design, manufacture, implementation, and life-cycle issues of engineering systems. The remaining courses
provide a disciplinary focus. The program embraces and balances qualitative, as well as quantitative, aspects and utilizes
state-of-the-art tools and methodologies. It aims to educate students in problem-solving methodologies, modeling, analysis,
simulation, and technical management. The program trains engineers in relevant software applications and their productive
deployment and integration in the workplace. For a detailed description of this program, please see the Interdisciplinary
Programs section of this catalog.

Electrical and Computer Engineering Track
The track in Electrical and Computer Engineering emphasizes the major themes intrinsic to design, manufacture, and
implementation of electronic systems, as well as the transmission of signals and information in a digital format, emergent
hardware principles, software integration, and data manipulation algorithms. Mathematical principles underlie all aspects of
engineered systems, and a solid background in such principles is emphasized. Today’s systems also reflect an integration of
several means of manipulating signals, ranging from traditional analog filters to advanced digital signal processing techniques.
The three courses that are common to Electrical and Computer Engineering emphasize the above. The remaining three
courses can be either in Electrical Engineering, which emphasizes core principles guiding the design, manufacture, and
implementation of today’s diverse set of electronic systems, or in Computer Engineering, which provides a background in the
principles and practices related to data/information systems design and implementation.

Doctoral Programs
Admission requirements to the Ph.D. program are naturally more stringent than those for the lesser degrees. More attention is
paid to the student’s background and potential to perform independent research. All applications are considered individually.
In general, admissions are granted to students with a master’s degree in electrical engineering or computer engineering who
have achieved a minimum GPA of 3.5 on a 4.0 scale. Exceptional students may be accepted after receiving the bachelor’s
degree. Submission of GRE scores is recommended, but not required.
The Ph.D. degree requires 84 credits. A maximum of 30 credits can be applied toward the 84-credit requirement of the
Ph.D. from a previous master’s degree or from any other graduate courses subject to the approval of the advisor. All Ph.D.
candidates must take at least 30 credits of thesis work and at least 20 credits of course work at Stevens beyond the master’s
degree. Courses counting towards the Ph.D. degree are expected to be taken from the ECE catalog courses (approval by the
student’s advisor is required to apply courses outside the ECE program to the Ph.D. degree).
All Ph.D. candidates must pass the written Ph.D. qualifying examination. Students may take the qualifying examination only
twice. Failure to pass the qualifying examination in the second attempt will result in dismissal from the Ph.D. program.
After the student has successfully completed the qualifying examination, (s)he must arrange for an advisor to assist in the
development of a thesis proposal. The advisor must be a full-time ECE professor or professor emeritus. Once a suitable topic
has been found and agreed upon with the advisor, the student must prepare a thesis proposal. This thesis proposal should
be completed and defended within one year of passing the Ph.D. qualifying examination. The proposal must indicate the
direction that the thesis will take and procedures that will be used to initiate the research. Ordinarily, some preliminary results
are included in the proposal. In addition, the proposal must indicate that the student is familiar with the research literature
in his/her area. To this end, the proposal must include the results of a thorough literature search. A committee of at least
three faculty members must accept the written thesis proposal. The committee chairperson is the thesis advisor. The other
two members should be ECE department faculty. After the written proposal has been accepted, the examination committee
conducts an oral defense. At this defense, the student presents his/her proposal.
All Ph.D. candidates who are working on a thesis must have a thesis committee chaired by the thesis advisor and consisting
of at least four members. The thesis advisor and at least two other members must be full-time faculty members or professors
emeritus of the ECE department. In addition, there must be one member who is a regular faculty member within another
department at Stevens. It is permissible and desirable to have as a committee member a highly-qualified person from outside
of Stevens. The committee must approve the completed thesis unanimously. After the thesis has been completed, it must
be publicly defended.

Degree of Electrical Engineer and Degree of Computer Engineer
These programs provide opportunities for the student to proceed with professional development beyond the master’s level.
The course work may be directed toward depth in the area of the master’s degree or toward depth in a new area related to
that of the master’s degree. A design project of significance is required.
To be admitted to the Electrical Engineer or Computer Engineer program, the student must have a master’s degree in
electrical engineering or computer engineering with a minimum grade point average of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale and the agreement
of at least one regular faculty member in the department who expresses a willingness to serve as project advisor. Outstanding
applicants with degrees in other disciplines may be admitted subject to demonstration of the technical background expected
(perhaps with the requirement for completion of appropriate ramp courses or their equivalents with a grade of “B” or better).
Such applicants, as well as applicants with significant career experiences but not satisfying the primary requirements, will be
determined on an individual basis depending on the student’s background.
At least 30 credits beyond the master’s degree are required for the Engineer Degree. At least eight, but not more than fifteen,
credits must be in the design project. The project courses for EE and CPE are EE 950 and CPE 950, respectively. An ECE

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
faculty advisor and at least two faculty members must supervise the project; one must be a regular member of the faculty in
the ECE department. A written report and oral presentation are required.

Graduate Certificate Programs
The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers several graduate certificate programs to students meeting the
regular admission requirements for the master’s program. Each graduate certificate is self-contained and highly focused,
carrying 12 or more graduate credits. All of the courses may be used toward the master’s degree, as well as for the graduate
certificate.

Spread Spectrum and CDMA	

(3-3-0)

Provides depth in the several topics related to signal processing and data processing that appear within wireless communications
systems. The treatment is mathematical, providing depth in the analytic formulations and analysis techniques. Digital signal
processing techniques will be given particular emphasis, recognizing their considerable influence on present and emerging
designs. However, these digital signal processing techniques will be supplemented by analog signal processing techniques
will be supplemented by analog signal processing techniques, which continue to be important for front-ends of receivers
(and will remain important as carrier frequencies continue to migrate to higher frequencies). In addition to covering the
mathematical principles of digital and analog signal processing, the course will cover contemporary digital signal processors.
The data processing issue arises in the coding of data for improved communications performance. Compression algorithms,
reducing the amount of data that must be transmitted, coding techniques to provide error detection/protection, and encryption
techniques to improve security are representative examples of data processing.

EE 685	

Physical Design of Wireless Systems	

(3-3-0)

The emphasis will be on the design of the transmitter and receiver sections of a wireless system, but antenna design
will also be covered to provide an understanding of the techniques used to achieve directional and steerable antennas
when appropriate for the given wireless system. The wide range of carrier frequencies seen in wireless systems leads to a
variety of semiconductor and other technologies being required at different carrier frequencies. In addition, the bandwidth
of the signal leads to substantially different issues arising in the packaging used for the transmitter and receiver ends.
For lower carrier frequencies, advanced silicon IC technologies are preferred, given the maturity of the technology and
the considerable density of both analog and digital circuitry that can be integrated on a single IC. At higher frequencies,
the limits of contemporary silicon technologies are encountered, leading to use of specialized semiconductor technologies
such as GaAs and SiGe circuits. In addition, the difficulty of realizing high accuracy analog/digital conversions at multi-GHz
frequencies leads to a preference, at this time, for analog for analog circuitry at the higher frequencies. On the other hand,
analog/digital conversions are becoming possible at sufficiently high sampling rates that digital processing is being strongly
pursued directly at the front end of a receiver, allowing a variety of new techniques to be considered for the overall receiver
design. In cases where front-end digital signal processing cannot be achieved, such digital processing is increasingly used
at intermediate frequencies (i.e., the IF section). In the case of data communications, digital techniques are almost certainly
used at baseband, for example to separate the data signal from the received analog signal, to perform data decoding, etc. The
course will include material related to contemporary digital signal processor technologies, supplementing the discussions in
Course 2 by considering in greater depth the physical design and performance limitations of technologies and architectures.

High-Level Operation, Performance, Standards, and	
Control of Wireless Communications Systems

(3-3-0)

Provides the student with depth in the overall understanding of the high-level definition and operation of a contemporary
wireless system. Since many wireless systems involve connections among hardware developed by different commercial
manufacturers, national and international standards play a major role in the evolution of wireless systems. Earlier first
generation systems evolved to today’s second generation systems, with third generation systems expected shortly. One
component of this course relates to these important standards. There are several fundamentally different wireless systems
applications simultaneously evolving. Some relate to personal communications services (e.g., cellular telephony, wireless
modems, etc.). Others relate to LANs, implemented in wireless rather than wired technologies to allow mobility or ease of
access but providing data rates competitive with wired systems. Satellite communications systems (e.g., the Iridium system)
are emerging and promise to provide a particularly interesting means of extending communication services. GPS systems
provide an important means of determining one’s position to high accuracy. Digital and software radios exploit the familiar
concept of radio transmissions to provide digital information (and draw upon channel assignment schemes related to the
radio metaphor). In addition to the commercial development of separate (and non-integrated) wireless systems of the various
types above, there are important military applications in which the various systems are integrated to provide a versatile
communications systems designed for battlefield applications. Upon completion of this course, the student will have depth
of understanding in the high-level, systems-oriented view of wireless systems.

UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS
Bachelor of Science in Mathematics
The Bachelor of Science in Mathematics offers a broad background appropriate for students planning to pursue a job in
industry, while also offering students the depth and rigor required for graduate studies in mathematics or related fields.
The curriculum satisfies the core Bachelor of Science curriculum that includes certain breadth requirements in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, the humanities and social sciences. In addition to this science core, the
student completes twelve upper-level mathematics courses (called technical electives). Some of these technical courses
are prescribed by the program as being foundational to an undergraduate degree in mathematics. The remaining technical
electives are chosen by the student in consultation with his/her academic advisor. In some cases courses from other
departments can be substituted as technical electives with the approval of the undergraduate advisor. The program also
includes two general electives which can be applied toward a minor or a second major in another discipline. Entering
freshmen mathematics majors are expected to enroll in the seminar course MA 188 once they have completed the Calculus I
requirement. Students interested in taking computer science courses beyond the minimum requirement should plan to take
Discrete Mathematics, MA 134, no later than Term 3. Writing a senior thesis is strongly recommended, especially for students
interested in pursuing graduate studies. As early as possible, students should discuss with the academic advisor how best to
use the electives to focus the program on a particular area of mathematics.
The link to the mathematics curriculum takes you to a recommended study plan. The courses do not need to be taken
in exactly the order listed. See the Department of Mathematics Web page for information on when particular courses are
offered. There are additional notes at the end of the study plan regarding recommended electives and possible course
substitutions. Mathematics majors are required to submit an approved study plan in Term 2.

Minor in Mathematics
A minor in mathematics can be a valuable qualification for students concentrating in other areas. A student wishing to pursue
a minor in mathematics must complete a Minor Program Study Plan signed by the department advisor for mathematics, and
meet the School of Engineering and Science requirements for minor programs.
Required courses for a Minor in Mathematics:
MA 221 Differential Equations
MA 227 Multivariable Calculus
MA 222 Probability and Statistics
MA 232 Linear Algebra

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
MA 234 Complex Variables with Applications
One elective at 300 or above chosen with the consent of the Department advisor.
Course substitutions are possible with the approval of the department advisor. Typical substitutions are Multivariable Calculus
& Optimization, MA 230, in place of MA 227 and the Probability & Statistics course used in the engineering curriculum,
E-243, in place of MA 222.
Completion of Calculus II (MA-124 or MA-116) is a prerequisite for undertaking the minor program:

Interdisciplinary Program in Computational Science
Computational Science is an emerging field which emphasizes the use of sophisticated computational techniques and
algorithms for solving complex and difficult problems related to science and engineering. At Stevens, undergraduates may
study computational science through an interdisciplinary program leading to a Bachelor of Science in Computational Science
with a specialization in an area of science or engineering. The program combines theory and techniques from mathematics,
mathematical modeling, computer science and coding with knowledge and experience in a particular application area of
science or engineering. It complements existing theoretical and experimental approaches and may be thought of as a new
mode of scientific inquiry.
The program consists of the same science curriculum core courses as the mathematics program along with the twelve
technical electives. Computational Science majors will take CS 115 as the computer science requirement since this course
is a prerequisite for additional CS courses required in the program. The technical electives are divided between foundation
courses in mathematics and computer science, and at least five application courses in the student’s area of specialization.
An important part of the program is a project or research problem to be done in the senior year so the five application
courses will include one or two semesters of Senior Research, MA 498/499. Each student must choose an application area
prior to preparing his/her study plan. Each student’s study plan reflects his/her interests and aspirations, and is made up by
the student, working with an advisor from the application area. Interested students should consult with the undergraduate
program director in the Department of Mathematical Sciences for further information.
The link to the computational science curriculum shows a recommended study plan including the core and foundation
courses. Courses need not be taken in exactly the order shown in the curriculum. Specific choices for the application area
are made in consultation with the student’s academic advisor from Mathematical Sciences and a co-advisor from another
department with expertise in the application area.
Typical areas of specializations include:
Computational Chemistry
Computational Mechanics
Computational Oceanography
Computational Physics
Computer Vision and Computer Graphics
Cybersecurity
Environmental Systems

Doctoral Program
Admission Requirements
Admission to the doctoral program requires the preparation specified above. If your goal is a Ph.D., you should apply directly
to the doctoral program and not to a master’s program. In order to receive full consideration, applications to the doctoral
program should be received by February 15 for admission in the Fall Semester, and October 15 for admission in the spring
semester. Because of constraints due to course scheduling, admission for the spring semester is not always feasible and
may depend on the student’s preparation. In addition, financial aid is usually not available for students admitted in the spring
semester. Applicants requesting financial aid should apply by February 15 and clearly state that such aid is being requested.
Applications to the doctoral program should include the following items, all of which enter into the Graduate Program
Committee’s evaluation of applicants:
A personal statement that, in a succinct manner, describes the student’s reasons for pursuing a Ph.D., prior
classroom and research experience in mathematics, and current mathematical interests. This should not exceed
two pages.
Official transcripts and diplomas. For non-English-speaking institutions, these documents must be accompanied
by a certified English translation.
Letters of recommendation: at least two; at most, four.
GRE General Test scores (Math Subject Test recommended).

Financial Aid
The department supports a limited number of Ph.D. students through teaching assistantships which entitle the recipients
to a salary and a waiver of their tuition costs. Teaching assistants are considered for renewal each year, depending on the
student’s progress towards graduation and performance evaluations as a teaching assistant. Save for exceptional cases,
financial support from Stevens is limited to four years beyond the Master’s degree. Assistantships are usually available only
for students entering in the fall.
Students who wish to be considered for a teaching assistantship beginning their first year should mention this in their Personal
Statement. Students with prior teaching experience are encouraged to submit additional documentation that addresses their
teaching skills, such as letters of recommendation, evaluation forms, teaching awards, etc. However, no teaching experience
is required for an incoming student to be considered for a teaching assistantship.

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
Degree Requirements
The primary requirement for a doctoral degree in mathematics is that you produce a dissertation containing an original
and significant result in mathematics. You will work under the guidance of a faculty advisor who is an expert in your area of
research.
Preparation for dissertation work includes both courses in mathematical fundamentals and practice in communicating
mathematics orally and in writing. The courses you take will not necessarily include everything you will need to know. As a
doctoral student you will be expected to learn some mathematics on your own outside of class. Seminars afford a means to
that end. They can be organized informally among students or more formally with a faculty advisor. Seminars of the latter
type may be taken for academic credit. Students are encouraged to identify subjects they would like to study and to seek
out faculty advisors.
Coursework and Credits
The doctoral program requires 84 credits beyond the bachelor’s degree (54 credits beyond the master’s) of which at least
30 credits must be approved doctoral research credits (MA 960). This credit total includes the three-credit “Signature”
course, PRV961. A prior master’s degree may be transferred for up to 30 credits without specific course descriptions and
with approval of the department and the Dean of Graduate Academics. Up to one-third of additional course credits may be
transferred with the approval of the thesis committee and the Dean of Graduate Academics. The grade of “B” (3.0 GPA) or
better is required for such courses and such courses may not have been already used to obtain an academic degree.
General Exam
This is a written exam covering three subject areas, one of which must be real analysis. The elective subjects consists of
two-semester sequences such as probability and statistics, algebra I and algebra II, nonlinear optimization and advanced
methods of optimization, complex analysis and differential equations. Other subject choices are possible with the approval of
the Graduate Program Committee. The exam is offered once each semester. The General Exam should be attempted within
the first year of completing the masters degree or within the first year of study for students entering with a prior masters
degree. One failure of the General Exam is allowed. A second failure will result in the student being dropped from the Ph.D.
program. After passing the General Exam a student is officially recognized as a Ph.D. candidate.
Dissertation Advisory Committee
Within six months of becoming a doctoral candidate, the student needs to select a Research Advisor and agree upon a
research topic. The Research Advisor assists with recommending additional members for the student’s Dissertation Advisory
Committee.
Refer to the Graduate Student Handbook for further details on the requirements and process for approving the Advisory
Committee.
Dissertation
The final and most important step of the Ph.D. program is writing a dissertation of publishable quality. This will embody the
results of the student’s original research in mathematics, and the dissertation will be presented by the student at a public
defense. If the suitably appointed Dissertation Committee approves the defense, the student will be recommended to the
Office of Graduate Academics for the Ph.D. degree.

Graduate Certificates
The Mathematical Science department offers graduate certificates in Applied Statistics and Stochastic Systems. Each
program consists of four courses, including one elective chosen with the consent of the departmental advisor. Most courses
may be used toward a master’s degree, as well as for the certificate.

UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS
The range and scope of mechanical engineering has undergone radical changes over the past decade, while retaining and
expanding traditional areas of endeavor. Some of the changes have been due to the improvements in auxiliary fields, such
as materials, or the introduction of new fields, such as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), information technology,
nanotechnology, and bioengineering.
Traditionally, the design and production of machines have been major concerns of the mechanical engineer, working to the
basic criteria of cost, efficiency, and delivery date. Safety and environmental considerations have added new dimensions to
the mechanical engineer’s problem. This is most apparent for example, in the design of new automobiles, where improved
mileage and cleaner engines have been coupled with a reduction in weight and size, and greater emphasis on highway safety.
In all areas, increasing emphasis has been placed on synthesis, looking to the performance of complete systems as opposed
to that of single components. Career opportunities are traditionally found in such diverse areas as power generation, design
of machinery, manufacturing, research and development, guidance systems, product design and development, robotics,
propulsion engineering, system analysis and design, and many others.
Our graduates wishing to further their education have been successful in gaining admission to the graduate schools of their
choice.
Reflecting the wide diversity of subject matter to be found in the present-day practice of mechanical engineering, the
department offers a multitude of opportunities for study and research. Major areas of interest include: bio-mechanical
systems and biomedical devices, energy conversion, design and manufacturing, HVAC, solid mechanics, automatic controls,
dynamics, fluid mechanics, machine design, heat transfer, turbomachinery, combustion, robotics, and noise control. If you
have particular interests or highly-specific objectives, we can generally satisfy your individual goals through elective courses
and appropriate project work. Furthermore, the available pool of electives allows the student to specialize in one of the
following concentration areas:
Aerospace Engineering

Courses are selected to develop skills in a particular area of interest. While this coursework is necessary to develop the tools
and skills of the student’s profession, the most important aspect of the doctoral program is the student’s original research topic.
The subject of the doctoral dissertation (ME 960) is open to a wide range of particular choices. The selection of a topic by the
doctoral aspirant provides for a sub-specialization within the broad range of mechanical engineering disciplines. The courses
selected for the study plan should complement the student’s dissertation subject.
Upon submission of an approved study plan by the student and no later than after one year of enrollment in the program, a
Doctoral Committee is appointed for each student by the Department Director in conjunction with the Graduate Committee,
with the Advisor as the chairperson. All doctoral students are required to take a qualifying examination (consisting of a Core
Competency Test (CCT) and a Research Competency Test (RCT)) at the first offering after one year in the program. Upon
failing the qualifying examination, the student may take the examination for a second time at the next offering. Upon failing
the examination for the second time, the student will be asked to leave the program. In addition to the qualifying examination,
all doctoral students are required to present a research proposal (including a written report and an oral presentation) to
the Doctoral Committee for its approval. The candidate must present the proposal within 24 months of enrollment into the
program. The Doctoral Committee, at its discretion, may decide on additional oral/written examinations before accepting
the proposed dissertation plan. In the case where the committee rejects the research proposal, the candidate may submit a
request for a second and final chance for presenting a revised research proposal during the following academic semester.
Upon satisfactory completion of the research proposal and all coursework, the student will be considered a doctoral candidate
and continue the research which will form the basis of the student’s dissertation. The dissertation must be based upon
original investigation in the field of mechanical engineering, approved by the Department Director and Graduate Committee,
and must be a contribution worthy of publication in the current professional literature. Before receiving the doctoral degree,
the student must also satisfy the requirements for residence and publication of the dissertation.

Nanotechnology Concentration
The mechanical engineering doctoral program is an integral part of the institute-wide nanotechnology graduate program. A
Ph.D. degree option in mechanical engineering with concentration on nanotechnology is available to students who satisfy the
conditions and requirements of the nanotechnology area which are outlined in a separate section of the catalog.

Ph.D. Requirements
Applicants with a GPA of 3.5 or better in a master’s program in mechanical engineering or a related field as well as with
excellent TOEFL and GRE scores are encouraged to apply for the Ph.D. program in mechanical engineering. Exceptionally
well qualified applicants who obtained only a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering or a related field will also be
considered for direct admission into the Ph.D. program in mechanical engineering. The Ph.D. Qualifying Examination
consists of a Core Competency Test and a Research Competency Test to be taken after one year in the Ph.D. program.
The Ph.D. program in mechanical engineering requires a total of 84 credits beyond the bachelor’s degree in an approved
program of study. Up to 30 credits previously obtained in a master’s degree program in mechanical engineering or a related
field may be applied towards this requirement. In addition, the Ph.D. program in mechanical engineering culminates in a
Ph.D. dissertation based on the results of original research carried out under the guidance of a faculty member and defended
in a public examination.

Graduate Certificate Programs
The Mechanical Engineering Department offers several graduate certificate programs to students meeting the regular
admission requirements for the master’s program. Each graduate certificate program is self-contained and highly focused,
carrying 12 or more graduate credits. All of the courses may be used toward the Master of Engineering degree, as well as for
the graduate certificate. Current graduate programs include:

UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS
The laws of physics govern the universe from the formation of stars and galaxies, to the processes in the Earth’s atmosphere
that determine our climate, to the elementary particles and their interactions that hold together atomic nuclei. Physics
also drives many rapidly-advancing technologies, such as information technology, telecommunication, nanoelectronics, and
medical technology, including MRI imaging and laser surgery.
The physics program at Stevens combines classroom instruction with hands-on research experience in one of several stateof-the-art research laboratories (Photonics Science and Technology, Optical Communication and Nanodevices, Quantum
Electron Science and Technology, NanoPhotonics, Light and Life, or Ultrafast Spectroscopy and Communication). Perhaps
the most differentiating feature of the Stevens physics curriculum is SKIL (Science Knowledge Integration Ladder), a sixsemester sequence of project-centered courses. This course sequence lets students work on projects that foster independent
learning, innovative problem solving, collaboration and team work, and knowledge integration under the guidance of a faculty
advisor. The SKIL sequence starts in the sophomore year with projects that integrate basic scientific knowledge and simple
concepts. In the junior and senior years, the projects become more challenging and the level of independence increases.

Bachelor of Science in Physics
Our B.S. degree in Physics is accredited by the Middle States Accreditation Board. Our graduates have a wide range of
career opportunities beyond the pursuit of a traditional graduate degree in physics, including employment in a variety of other
industries, such as telecommunications, optics, finance, medical technology, or defense. Those who choose to further their
physics education are accepted into graduate programs at some of the best schools.
Qualified students may participate in faculty-supervised projects.
Possible technical electives during the later semesters to ensure a complete undergraduate curriculum:
PEP 501 Fundamentals of Atomic Physics (3-0-3)
PEP 503 Introduction to Solid State Physics (3-0-3)
PEP 506 Modern Astrophysics and Cosmology (3-0-3)

Bachelor of Science in Engineering Physics (EP)
The Department of Physics and Engineering Physics also offers an undergraduate Engineering Physics (EP) Program, which
leads to a B.S. degree in Engineering Physics in three concentrations (see below). The program aims to attract students who
are intrigued by the possibility of combining a mastery of basic physics concepts with exposure to state-of-the-art engineering
technology in selected high-tech areas. The EP Program is a special program that was developed jointly by the Department
of Physics and Engineering Physics and the School of Engineering and Science. Students in the EP Program follow a special
core curriculum that provides the basic concepts of engineering together with a basic understanding of physical phenomena
at a microscopic level and lets them explore the relation of the physics concepts to practical problems of engineering
in one of three high-tech areas of concentration: Applied Optics, Microelectronics and Photonics, or Atmospheric and
Environmental Science. These concentrations represent high-tech areas of significant current local and global technological
and economic interest. The PEP department has both research strengths and educational expertise in these areas where
there is significant growth potential. For all concentrations, required and/or elective courses offered by other departments
(EE, EN, and MT) can be used to complement departmental course offerings, which provide the students in the program with
the necessary diversity, breadth, and depth of educational offerings and research opportunities. The following curriculum
shows the common two years and then the final two years separately for each concentration.

Minors
A minor represents a coherent program of study in a discipline other than the student’s major degree program. Successful
completion of a minor program is recognized on the transcript and with a Minor Certificate at graduation. Recognition is thus
provided for a significant educational experience in another discipline.
General requirements for minor programs in engineering or science:
Entry to a minor program requires a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5.
A student wishing to pursue a minor program must complete a Minor Program Study Plan signed by a Minor
Advisor from the relevant discipline. Each minor requires a separate study plan and a student can earn no more
than two minors in engineering and science.
The minor program must be in a discipline other than that of a student’s major program of study. As such, minors
are distinguished from options within the major discipline or concentrations within the chosen major program.
The minor program will consist of a coherent sequence of at least six courses. A minimum of two courses
(minimum six credits) must be in addition to those courses required to complete a student’s major degree
program (which includes general education courses).
In order for a course to count towards a minor, a grade of C or above must be achieved. At the discretion of the
Minor Advisor, transfer credits may be applied to a minor, but these must constitute fewer than half of those
applied to the minor program.
To receive the minor at graduation, the student must complete a Minor Candidacy Form signed by the Minor
Advisor after all minor requirements are fulfilled.

Interdisciplinary Program in Computational Science
For students interested in interdisciplinary science and engineering, Stevens offers an undergraduate computational science
program. Computational science is a new field in which techniques from mathematics and computer science are used to solve
scientific and engineering problems. See the description of the Program in Computational Science in the Interdisciplinary
Programs section.

GRADUATE PROGRAMS
The graduate program in physics is designed for the student who desires to master fundamental concepts and techniques,
who is interested in studying applications in various areas of technology and science, and who wishes to keep abreast of
the latest experimental and theoretical innovations in these areas. We offer a varied curriculum consisting of either highly
specialized courses or broad training in diverse areas.
When you seek an advanced degree, you can gain both breadth and specialization. The required degree courses provide
broad skills in basic physics; the elective choices give highly specialized training in a variety of different areas. The Department
of Physics and Engineering Physics is large enough to offer rich and varied programs in pure and applied physics, yet it is
small enough to sustain the sense of a coherent community in search of knowledge.

Admissions Requirements
For all graduate programs in physics a B.S. degree is required, which includes the following course work: calculusbased three- or four-semester introductory physics sequence in thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism,
mechanics, quantum mechanics, and mathematical methods.
Ph. D, applicants lacking the above courses are required to take the indicated courses for no graduate credit.

Doctoral Program - Physics
Doctoral students conduct exciting and cutting-edge research with faculty who are leaders in the field. Ph.D. students must
pass a qualifying examination, which consists of two oral examinations. The first oral examination tests mastery of a set of
core physics topics (based on core courses PEP 538, 542, 553, 555) while the second oral examination tests the student’s
ability to discuss physics problems and current research topics with an examining committee of three faculty members.
Candidates have two opportunities to pass each examination. The first attempt must be made within the first two years of
study at Stevens. Upon successful completion of both examinations, the student becomes a qualified Ph.D. candidate.
Within six weeks after passing the qualification examination a Ph.D. advisory committee shall be formed for each Ph.D.
student, consisting of a major advisor on the physics department faculty, an additional physics department faculty member,
and a third Stevens faculty member from any department other than Physics. Additional committee members from Stevens
or elsewhere may also be included.
Ph.D. candidates are required to have competency in using computer-based methods of calculation and analysis. Students
lacking this competency are encouraged to take PEP 520 Computational Physics, or equivalent.
In addition to the core courses required in the 30-credit Master of Science in physics degree (PEP 642, PEP 643, PEP 644,
PEP 554, PEP 528, PEP 555, and PEP 510 and one 600-level advanced quantum mechanics course), completion of the
following coursework will be required for the Ph. D.
PEP 667 Statistical Mechanics
One 600-level quantum mechanics application course
Two 700-level courses chosen in consultation with an academic advisor
Three Ph.D. signature credits (can be in one or multiple approved courses)
Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

389

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
The student will carry out an original research program under the supervision of the major advisor and advisory committee.
The results of the research will be presented in a written dissertation. Upon approval of the advisory committee, the written
dissertation will be defended by the student in an oral defense. A minimum of 84 credits beyond the baccalaureate degree
is required for the Ph.D. degree. Required coursework represents at least 18 credits. At least 12 of the remaining 66 credits
must be for the Ph.D. research (PEP 960).
Applications are welcome from students who have already earned a master’s degree elsewhere. Applicants with the
equivalent of the Stevens Master of Science in physics degree are eligible to take the qualifying exam immediately and
become candidates without additional course requirements. Nevertheless, they have to fulfill all described requirements
including doctoral coursework, research, any core courses of the Stevens Master of Science in physics which they have not
taken in the course of their previous Masters degree, and a total of 54 credits beyond the master’s degree.
Applicants with a non-physics master’s degree may be required to complete sufficient coursework to meet the requirements
for a physics degree in addition to the remaining doctoral requirements outlined above. The details of the makeup work are
determined by the department’s Graduate Academic Standards and Curriculum committee.

Doctoral Program - Interdisciplinary
In addition to the Ph.D. program in Physics the Department of Physics and Engineering Physics offers an interdisciplinary
Ph.D. program in cooperation with other departments in Stevens Institute of Technology. This program aims to address the
increasingly cross-cutting nature of doctoral research. The interdisciplinary Ph.D. program aims to take advantage of the
complementary educational offerings and research opportunities in multiple areas. Any student who wishes to enter an
interdisciplinary program needs to obtain the consent of the participating departments and the subsequent approval of the
Dean of Graduate Studies. The student will follow a study plan designed by his/her faculty advisor. In particular, the student
must declare which department will be the home department (i.e. the department where the majority of courses is being
taken), and arrange for written consent of advisors in both departments involved.
The student will be granted official candidacy in the program upon successful completion of a qualifying exam that will be
administered according to the applicable guidelines of the Office of Graduate Studies. For all interdisciplinary programs
involving the physics department as either home or secondary department the student is required to pass the first part of the
regular Ph.D. qualifying exam of the Physics Department (general physics, based on core courses PEP 538, 542, 553, 555)
as well as the corresponding qualifying exam of the other participating department.
All policies of the Office of Graduate Studies that govern the credit and thesis requirements apply to students enrolled in this
interdisciplinary program. Identical to the Physics Ph.D. program the interdisciplinary Ph.D. program requires 84 credits. For
student with the Physics Department as the home department the following additional guidelines apply:
A master’s degree comparable to the Stevens’ Master of Engineering Physics will be recognized and be accounted
for with up to 30 credits, whereby the following courses (or equivalent) must be part of the Masters PEP 542,
PEP 554.
Required core courses of an interdisciplinary Ph.D. if PEP is the home department:
PEP 538 Introduction to Mechanics
NANO / PEP 555 Statistical Physics and Kinetic Theory
PEP 643 Electricity and Magnetism I
PEP 644 Electricity and Magnetism II
And Two 600-level courses (in the PEP or secondary department)
One 700-level course (in the PEP or secondary department)

SCHAEFER SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
These requirements allow a student to obtain an Interdisciplinary Ph.D. degree with a designated concentration in
nanotechnology and the PEP Department as home department following the requirement of the Nanotechnology Graduate
Program (NGP). To qualify for the nanotechnology concentration, the student has to satisfy all the above requirements for
an interdisciplinary PhD and must additionally complete the NGP common core courses (NANO 600 and NANO525/625),
a minimum of five elective NANO courses, as well as regularly attend the seminar series in the Nanotechnology Curriculum
(NANO 700). Note that the requirement for five elective NANO courses are allowed to overlap with the requirements for an
interdisciplinary PhD involving the PEP department, in particular, courses NANO/PEP553, NANO/PEP554, NANO/PEP555
are cross-listed with the NPG program. In addition, a Ph.D. candidate must successfully execute a doctoral dissertation in
the realm of nanotechnology. Interested students should follow the normal graduate application procedures through the Dean
of Graduate Studies.

Graduate Certificate Programs
The Department of Physics and Engineering Physics offers five Graduate Certificate programs to students meeting the regular

Undergraduate Programs
ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
Stevens has a 140-year history of leading innovation in engineering, science and technology. One of the first universities in
the world to offer an engineering management program, today, Stevens continues to advance the discipline of Engineering
Management for the 21st century.
The Stevens Engineering Management program prepares students to become decision makers that are able to engineer
solutions for complex management problems. Upon graduation, students are able to assume professional positions of
increasing responsibility across a broad range of industries, such as: healthcare, technology, business, finance, manufacturing,
and information systems.

Bachelor of Engineering in Engineering Management
Engineering Management (EM) is a rapidly expanding field that integrates engineering, technology, management, systems,
and business. High-technology companies in the telecommunications, financial services, manufacturing, pharmaceutical,
consulting, information technology and other industries utilize the concepts and tools of EM such as project management,
quality management, engineering economics, modeling and simulation, systems engineering and integration, and statistical
tools. These technology-based companies recruit EM graduates for their expertise in these tools and techniques and to fill a
critical need of integrating engineering and business operations.
The EM program combines a strong engineering core with training in accounting, cost analysis, managerial economics,
quality management, project management, production and technology management, systems engineering, and engineering
design. The course selection offered by this major exemplifies the Stevens interdisciplinary approach to developing strong
problem-solving skills. The program prepares students for careers that involve the complex interplay of technology, people,
economics, information, and organizations. The program also provides the skills and knowledge needed to enable students
to work effectively at the interface between engineering and management and to assume professional positions of increasing
responsibility in management or as key systems integrators. Concentrations are available in two areas:
Systems Engineering
Financial Engineering

Bachelor of Engineering in Engineering Management Mission & Objectives
The mission of the Bachelor of Engineering in Engineering Management (BEEM) Program is to provide an education based
on a strong engineering core, complemented by studies in business, technology, systems, and management, to prepare the
graduate to work at the interface between technology/engineering and management, and to be able to assume positions of
increasing technical and managerial responsibility. The objectives of the EM program can be summarized as follows:
EM graduates define, design, develop and assess solutions, as well as manage resources and processes to
address complex multidisciplinary problems through their strong broad-based foundation and engineering
management education and knowledge of modern technological tools.
EM graduates effectively lead and work on multidisciplinary project teams and are able to communicate and solve
real world problems using knowledge and tools gained from their engineering management education.
EM graduates continue sustained intellectual growth in the corporate or academic world.

Graduate Programs
Today’s engineered systems are more complex than their predecessors, not only in the sophistication of elements from which
they are constructed, but in the number and nature of the interconnections between those elements. System failures today,
whether an automobile malfunction on a busy highway or the loss of a spacecraft on a distant planet, are much more likely
to result from an unanticipated interaction between elements than from the failure of a single part.
Enterprises represent a special case of systems, one with enormous economic importance. While not traditionally considered
within the same domain as technical systems, enterprises are increasingly viewed as representatives of a broader class of
human designed systems, of which technical systems are only one example.
Stevens created the School of Systems and Enterprises (SSE) with the mission to provide interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary
education and research rooted in systems thinking. We focus on applying a “systems approach” to better understand the
nature of problems and opportunities, and to conceive novel concepts and solutions that achieve breakthrough results.
The following graduate programs are offered by SSE.

Master of Science

Financial Engineering
The vast complexity of financial markets compels industry to look for experts who not only understand how they work, but also
possess the mathematical knowledge to uncover their patterns and the computer skills to exploit them. To achieve success,
banking and securities industries must come to grips with securities valuation, risk management, portfolio structuring, and
regulation-knowledge embracing applied mathematics, computational techniques, statistical analysis, and economic theory.
The goal of the degree is to produce graduate who can make pricing, hedging, trading, and portfolio-management decisions
in the financial services enterprise. With sharply honed practical skills complimented by strong technical elements, graduates
are in demand in the industries-investment banking, risk management, securities trading and portfolio management. Students

Master of Engineering
Engineering Management
Many engineers find themselves at a decision point about five years after graduation, when they must choose either to
continue with their technical specialty or to enter the ranks of technical management. Those who choose the latter often
find themselves inadequately prepared for their new responsibilities, having little experience or training in management,
accounting, business strategy, team development and other vital management skills. Engineering Management fills these
gaps in engineering and science education with studies in business, management and systems engineering by affording the
traditional engineer with formal education in the human, financial, and management skills necessary to develop high quality,
cost efficient, technically complex systems and products.

Master of Philosophy
The Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) is a postgraduate research degree. It is offered to enrolled Ph.D. students who achieve
a record of distinction during the pre-dissertation phase. Because the Master of Philosophy is not designed as a terminal
degree, its requirements are integrated with the requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy degree: potential candidates for
the Master of Philosophy degree must be qualified to pursue the doctorate and have been advised to apply for admission to
a doctoral program.
This degree requires a minimum of two years of advanced study beyond the master’s degree. Placed between the Master’s
degree and the Doctor of Philosophy, the Master of Philosophy marks a student’s successful completion of all requirements
for the doctorate, except the final phase of research and the dissertation. The degree is intended to provide recognition that
a prospective doctoral candidate has successfully and expeditiously completed a major phase of graduate study and has
achieved a comprehensive mastery of the general field of concentration.

DOCTORAL PROGRAMS
The programs leading to the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree are designed to develop the student’s ability to perform
research or high-level design in Systems Engineering, Financial Engineering, Engineering Management and/or Enterprise
Systems. Admission to the doctoral program is made through the school’s Committee on Doctoral Admissions (CDA) and is
based on a review of the candidate’s scholastic record, professional accomplishments and the fit between his/her research
objectives and those of the available SSE faculty. All admitted students must have the potential to advance the state of the
art in their field of research.
For domestic students, admission to the doctoral programs in SSE requires that the candidate has graduated from an ABET
accredited undergraduate program, preferably in engineering or science. A master’s degree is usually required before a
student is admitted to the doctoral program. A student’s master’s level academic performance and/or career must reflect his/
her ability to pursue advanced studies and perform independent research. Typically a GPA of 3.5 or better at master’s level
and 3.0 or better at the undergraduate level is required for admission to the doctoral program. International students must
also demonstrate proficiency in the English language prior to admission by scoring at least 550 (210 for computer-based) on
the TOEFL examination.
All doctoral applicants are required to submit Graduate Record Exam (GRE) results. Applicants may submit GMAT scores in
lieu of GREs for the Doctorate in Engineering Management and Financial Engineering.
In addition, each applicant must submit a current resume or curriculum vitae, three recommendations, evidence of written
work and a statement of purpose. The Statement of Purpose should be limited to three pages and describe the applicant’s
academic interests, proposed course work, research interests and rationale, general career objectives and desired full/
part-time student status. Applicants are strongly encouraged to review the available doctoral advisors on the SSE website
http://www.stevens.edu/school-systems-enterprises/faculty and identify those who they believe are most closely aligned
with their desired areas of research in their Statement of Purpose. The Statement of Purpose not only represents the student’s
interests, motivations and goals, but also is a reflection of his/her ability to communicate effectively and reflects the maturity
of his/her research aspirations. Each applicant must submit an example of his/her written technical work. This work should
be written solely by the applicant; published work, if available, is most desirable. All applications for part-time studies must
include a letter of commitment from the applicant’s employer.

4+1 Program with Drew University
Stevens Institute of Technology (Stevens) and Drew University (Drew) have established a 4+1 and a 4+1.5 Bachelor of Arts /
Master of Science partnership. Drew University currently offers students a B.A. in computer science, a minor in computer
science and multiple liberal arts degrees. Based on the student’s course of study and their academic performance, they will
pursue different paths as they work towards a Software Engineering M.S. degree at Stevens. Students with a major or minor in
computer science will take two master level software engineering courses at Drew enabling them to complete their Masters,
potentially in one academic year at Stevens with the successful completion of 8 courses. Students without a computer
science major or minor from Drew will complete their Masters at Stevens with 10 Stevens’ courses, which they are expected
to complete successfully in a year and half.
The purpose of these programs is to provide qualified students at Drew University with a seamless pathway into the Master
of Science in Software Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology. The details of these programs are explained in more
detail below.

4+1 Program
The Drew University / Stevens Institute of Technology 4+1 B.A./M.S. in Software Engineering program allows qualified
computer science majors or minors to complete the Bachelor of Arts degree at Drew and the Master of Science degree at
Stevens in five years instead of the five and one half years that it would normally require.
Students are eligible to apply to the Drew/Stevens program coordinator for provisional acceptance once they have completed
48 credits towards Drew graduation. The requirements for provisional acceptance are a GPA of at least 3.0 overall and in their
computer science courses, recommendation of the Drew/Stevens program coordinator, and no academic integrity violations.
CSCI 540 and 600 successfully completed at Drew with a grade of 3.3 or above will be transferred to Stevens and applied
to the M.S. in Software Engineering as the equivalent of SSW 540 and 690. Taking these two courses at Drew reduces
the number of credits needed for the M.S. degree, thus allowing the M.S. in Software Engineering to be completed in one

Community and Resilience	

(3-3-0)

Cities, even large global mega-cities, can best be understood as a collection of communities in neighborhoods, all served
by common urban infrastructures. To many citizens, those infrastructures were invisible until they failed in times of crisis.
Their lack of resilience brought home the point that community needs drive the functional requirements for buildings and
infrastructure. Delivered as a combination of lectures and seminars, we can begin to address questions such as “How do
we measure functionality at the many scales that affect community?” and “How are their benefits and costs delivered to
each significantly different community within the city?” Finally, “How do we measure the resilience we seek to achieve at a
community level?”

Architecting the Extended Enterprise	

(3-3-0)

This course presents a systems architecting process to achieve enterprise integration both within and between corporate
boundaries. The process leverages systems thinking - the antithesis of scientific reductionism, which fails to appreciate the
interrelationships between components that make-up a system. Systems thinking has proven to be successful in the delivery
of integrated technology products, and is now being applied to understanding the structure and dynamics of organizations
for which communications and co-stuff in general is a key to business success; in other words inter-relationships are prime
in managing an enterprise. The systems approach further emphasizes emergence, wider systems and the environment.
These concepts are crucial to architecting an enterprise in consideration of issues of decentralization, alliance advantage,
and market phenomena. Prerequisites: SDOE 675

ES 683	

Design of Agile Systems and Enterprises	

(3-3-0)

The frontier of systems engineering today seeks new levels of system capability and behavior, and expects to find that benefit
in higher forms of systems that elude traditional control and creation concepts. Common themes converge here in a study
of agility across a seemingly wide variety of interesting system types, characterized principally by aspects of self-organization
and systems of systems. Esthetic quality in systems and enterprises makes the difference between enforced compliance
and embraced experience; and determines the positive or negative vectors of self-organization and emergence. This module
explores the value and nature of esthetic design quality, principles and architectures for harnessing self organized systems of
systems, agility as risk management and reality confrontation, and similar issues at the edge of agile system and enterprise
knowledge. (Formerly SYS790) Prerequisites: ES 678

Systems Thinking	

(3-3-0)

It takes something special for the term system to have such ubiquity. The downside is that it is overused, improperly so,
detracting from its power. This class builds upon a solid conceptual foundation to ensure that the system/enterprise is
properly defined, conceived, and realized. Uniquely, the class shows how it is possible to use systems in order to think more
deeply and to act more decisively. This approach is made possible by emphasizing the simultaneity of perspectives, the role
of paradox, and the centrality of soft issues in resolving complexity. The SystemitoolTM is used to structure and conduct
analysis of decisions. This class is aimed at policy and decision-makers at all levels in an organization. Prerequisites: SYS 625

Conception of CPS: Deciding What to Build and Why	

(3-3-0)

The first course focuses on the conceptual design portion of the lifecycle of Cyber-Physical systems. Critical elements include
the ideas of systems and design thinking, and elegant design. An Ideation process, as pioneered by the likes of IDEA and
other prominent design firms is used to spark the creative process. The opportunity is conceived and defined using Kano
Maps, marketing segmentation and conjoint analysis techniques. A QFD process is used to collect, organize and analyze
customer needs, and transform these into product specifications. Concepts are generated, selected and tested. Finally, these
concepts are specified using concept of operation, conceptual design and using case scenarios and technical requires. A
workshop on Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), particularly, SysML is used as a means for specification and also to
provide a foundation for future modeling work. Lectures are interspersed with individual and group project based activities.
the students go through a design review process in preparation for their final report.

SYS 672	

Desing of CPS: Ensuring Systems Work and Are Robust	

(3-3-0)

requirements to detailed architecture and design based on prioritized, allocated and traceable architecturally significant
requirements. Students will create models of system structure and activities, make appropriate technology selections, and
perform analyses for reliability, performance, safety and security. Trade space analyses will be performed.

SYS 673	

Implementation of CPS: Bringing Solutions to Life	

(3-3-0)

This third course focuses on the continuous implementation, integration, testing, analysis, and verification and validation of
cyber systems (CPS). This course builds on Course 2 using a metaphor where the students plan on a successful product
launch, using our project to work through continuous integration and test and ultimately bringing a robust solution to life
in the form of a working CPS system. We intersperse lectures with individual and group project based activities to ensure
that the developed system is functional and robust. We discuss and use the most effective techniques for fault and failure
tolerance, analysis, and testing method and principles. We plan to capitalize on simulation and physical systems resources
for continuous and automated testing and discuss the balance of testing versus analysis. The students will continuously
collect evidence of quality, performance measures and traceability information.

SYS 674	

Sustainment of CPS: Managing Evolution	

(3-3-0)

This course focuses on managing the evolution of a cyber-physical system after its initial release to the market until its
retirement. The course approaches this topic on three levels. The foundation is to put in place policies, processes and
infrastructure to support, maintain and respond to quality issues for released instances of the system. The second level is to
drive the evolution of the system’s capabilities and characteristics based on evolving needs and enabling technologies. The
third level is to proactively “disrupt” the market by reframing the opportunity and reinventing they system based on internal
innovation, or responding to external disruptions in the marketplace or the technology space. Prerequisites: SYS 671, and
SYS 672, and SYS 673

SYS 675

response to supply and demand and changing. This course illustrates the difference between static and dynamic pricing,
and covers various dynamic pricing models and methodologies for successful pricing. This course also illustrates the fact
that effective pricing optimization is based on modeling of demand and elasticity of demand at a very granular level. It will
explore various dynamic pricing models and explore and identify factors relevant in choosing dynamic pricing models that
best support the operational effectiveness, external environment and business strategy of a particular firm.

SYS 681	

Dynamic Modeling of Systems and Enterprise	

(3-3-0)

The course introduces students to fundamentals of system dynamics modeling of complex systems and enterprises. System
Dynamics is a modeling approach that has been developed at MIT in the 1960s. System dynamics is used for variety of
applications ranging from supply chain management, decision analysis, innovation diffusion and management and other
management as well as engineering applications of complex systems. This course we will cover the basic fundamentals of
systems dynamics and enable students to learn and build system dynamic models including causal links and loop diagrams,
stock and flows with application to modeling contagion in systems, innovation diffusion, delays in complex systems and many
more examples and applications.

Advances in System of Systems Engineering	

(3-3-0)

The discipline of Systems Engineering (SE) provides us with necessary engineering and management guidance to successfully
design and develop a system rather than focus on its separate individual components. However, due to the rapidly increasing
complexity of today’s dynamic environment, we are faced with the need to engineer multiple integrated complex systems.
In response to this emerging paradigm shift, a new discipline of System of Systems Engineering (SoSE) has evolved. This
course serves as an overview of the advances in SoSE and provides the students the capability to apply this knowledge in the
synthesis, analysis, and evaluation of activities during the lifecycle of a System of Systems (SoS) through case study analysis.

identification of system level architecture alternatives and considerations, including definition of objectives for physical
(hardware) and logical (software) structure, information and system assurance, behavior, cost, performance and human
integration based on the system concept at every level of system decomposition. System of System (SoS) architecture is
examined, addressing composition of multiple systems and engineering new, emergent behavior in the SoS. Examples used
will come from a variety of operational environments (e.g. communications systems, space systems, weapon systems, etc)
Special consideration is given to the importance of effective construction and transitioning of the SysML models to software
engineering for software intensive systems projects. Prerequisites: SYS 625, and SYS 650

Bachelor of Science in Quantitative Finance
The Stevens QF program has been designed to provide students with a thorough and rigorous foundation in this multidisciplinary field. Students will be selected for strong quantitative aptitude, high motivation and work ethic, and a strong
interest in the field of business and finance.
Over the course of eight semester terms, plus an optional intensive summer session in our study abroad module (typically in
the summer after Sophomore year), through approximately 140 credit-hours of course work, students may choose to follow
one out of four main “threads” in the QF curriculum.
Quantitative Methods: this thread draws on the curriculum of Stevens’ Mathematics department and includes a minimum
of one year of calculus, and one year of probability and statistics. Electives in this thread extend to more advanced calculus
(multivariable, stochastic) and other quantitative techniques used in advanced financial applications.
Required Coursework:
MA 232 - Linear Algebra
MA 331 - Intermediate Statistics
MA 450 - Optimization Models in Finance
FE 530 - Probability
Computer Science: this thread draws on the curriculum offered by the Stevens Computer Science department (in the School
of Science and Engineering). It begins at the introductory level, and includes seven core courses, building to a reasonable
proficiency in C++, basic financial modeling tools and techniques, and an intermediate level of proficiency in web- based
programming; beyond the required core. There are elective courses in fields such as data mining, machine learning and
computerized trading platform architectures for students interested in developing advanced computer science capabilities.
Required Coursework:
CS 442 - Databases
CS 559 - Machine Learning

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

QF XXX - Web Technologies for Finance (under development)
QF XXX - Data Visualization for Finance (under development)
Finance & Economics: (including Financial Engineering): this thread draws on both the Business & Technology Program
(Steven’s successful undergraduate business degree) and the graduate program in Financial Engineering (in the School
of Systems & Enterprises). It encompasses the standard business and finance foundation disciplines such as accounting,
economics, corporate and international finance and capital markets - as well as QF - specific topics such as financial
engineering, risk management, and market regulation & securities law. Electives drawn principally from the Financial
Engineering department cover advanced topics such as derivatives pricing, hedging strategies, fixed income securities and
computational finance.
Required Coursework:
BT 426 - Equity Valuation
BT 440 - Money, Banking and Financial Institutions

Graduate Programs
Business success in the 21st century is increasingly dependent on the strategic development and use of technology. This is
a complex challenge as the solution to many business problems relies on the convergence of a number of technologies and
their proper alignment with customer requirements and business strategy.
Our educational programs are directed at:
Technology professionals wishing to acquire business knowledge and management skills
Business professionals wishing to learn about technology and how technology must be managed to achieve
business objectives.
The School of Business offers the following master’s degree programs:
Master of Science in Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI&A)
Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS)
Master of Science in Management (MSM)
Master of Science in Finance (MFIN)
Master of Science in Enterprise Project Management (MS-EPM)
Master of Science in Network & Communication Management & Services (NCMS)
Master of Business Administration (MBA)
Master of Science in Technology Management (MSTM)
Executive MBA (EMBA)
Ph.D. in Business Administration
This catalog describes each of these degree programs in detail.

Educational Approach
The Business School’s graduate programs are designed to maximize the management potential of each student. Students
can choose concentrations within each degree program or electives that enable students to complement their degree by
specializing in a number of areas ranging from soft skills development to technical specialties outside the domain of the
concentration. Students may also choose electives from other schools at Stevens.
The School of Business faculty members are leaders in research and education in the business and technical disciplines that
are relevant to decision making, innovation and action in an increasingly global, technology-driven world. Our educational
programs provide students with knowledge that is both rigorous and relevant. Of equal importance, our programs emphasize
the holistic development of each individual student through the development of life-long skills and abilities such as oral and
written communication, team participation and leadership, decision making and ethical reasoning.

Ethics and Communications Education
Ethics Workshop: The ethics requirement is incorporated into the course work for the following required courses MGT 609
Project Management Fundamentals, BIA 650 Process Analytics and Optimization (for BI&A students), MGT 635 Managerial
Judgment & Decision Making (for MBA students) and MGT 798 Integration & Application of Technology Management (for
MSTM and EMBA students).

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

SCHOOL OF BUSINESS
Students are automatically enrolled in MGT 899 - Ethics Workshop at no cost. This workshop carries zero credit and will not
appear on the student’s official transcript. Completion of all exercises and the survey associated with the Ethics Workshop is
sufficient to satisfy the ethics requirement.
Communication Skills: Written and oral communications training and assessment are conducted in conjunction with the
following required courses: MGT 609 Project Management Fundamentals, BIA 650 Process Analytics and Optimization
(for BI&A students), MGT 630 Global Business & Markets (Oral Communications) and MGT 635 Managerial Judgment &
Decision Making (Written Communications) (for MBA students.)
Students in these courses are automatically enrolled in MGT 898: Writing Support and Assessment Program. This online
workshop carries zero credit and will not appear on the student’s official transcript. Students in the MSTM and EMBA
program take EMT 758 Oral & Written Communications, in lieu of MGT 898 for zero credit. Students who do not pass the
written assessment will be required to take MGT 897: Online Writing Tutorial for no cost for zero credit.

English Requirements for International Students
International students for whom English is a second language must demonstrate English language proficiency by submitting
the results of a TOEFL or an IELTS test. TOEFL and IELTS score requirements are identical to the ELC requirements listed on
pages 43-44 of the catalog.

MASTER OF SCIENCE IN BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND ANALYTICS (BI&A)
The MS in Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI&A) is designed for full-time and part-time students who have undergraduate
degrees in science, mathematics, computer science or engineering. The program produces analytical thinkers who can pursue
careers as data scientists in a variety of industries. The BI&A program includes courses in databases, data warehousing,
data mining, social networking and risk modeling. The program is both theoretical and applied in that each course combines
relevant theories and techniques with a number of examples and student exercises that illustrate industry applications of

Master of Philosophy
The Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) is a postgraduate research degree. It is offered to enrolled Ph.D. students who achieve
a record of distinction during the pre-dissertation phase. Because the Master of Philosophy is not designed as a terminal
degree, its requirements are integrated with the requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy degree: potential candidates for
the Master of Philosophy degree must be qualified to pursue the doctorate and have been advised to apply for admission to
a doctoral program.
This degree requires a minimum of two years of advanced study beyond the baccalaureate degree. Placed between the
Master’s degree and the Doctor of Philosophy, the Master of Philosophy marks a student’s successful completion of all
requirements for the doctorate, except the final phase of research and the dissertation. The degree is intended to provide
recognition that a prospective doctoral candidate has successfully and expeditiously completed a major phase of graduate
study and has achieved a comprehensive mastery of the general field of concentration.

PH.D. IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
The School of Business Ph.D. in Business Administration program defines itself at the intersection of three research domains:
Information Systems & Analytics, Entrepreneurship & Innovation Management and Finance. These three research domains
are strongly represented by the faculty of the Business School and provide different perspectives on business administration.
The design of the Ph.D. program is based on the assumption that novel research ideas often occur at the intersection of
different knowledge domains. The unique combination of these three research domains and their integrated discussion will
lead to creative and innovative research questions within and across these domains. The combination will also encourage
the development of the interdisciplinary skill sets necessary to conduct innovative research. The majority of Ph.D. programs
focus on theory and analytical skills. The integration of three research domains complements this fundamental skill set with
the skills necessary for creating and applying this knowledge. Our students are challenged to create new technologies for
analyzing relevant research questions related to important problems we face today.
Students of the program will chose one of the three research domains as their research focus and they can study aspects
of the other two domains as part of the program. Because of the specific integration of the knowledge domains the program
offers a truly interdisciplinary experience. This is achieved by a common set of required courses and by the selection of
individual courses.
Degree Requirements: The Ph.D. program in Business Administration consists of a minimum of 36 credits of coursework
and a maximum of 18 research credits.
Admission Requirements: The Ph.D. program is designed for the exceptional student possessing a strong quantitative
background and a degree in management or related topics. Students who are interested in joining the program must fulfill
the following requirements:
Students must have earned a 4-year undergraduate degree from an accredited college or university.
Students must have earned a master’s degree in Business, Finance, MIS or related field.
Students must have attained a basic knowledge of statistics comparable to MGT620 Statistical Models.
Students must have completed undergraduate course work in mathematics including the equivalent of two
semesters of calculus and one semester of linear algebra, or they must acquire this background before entering
the program.

COLLEGE OF ARTS AND LETTERS

COLLEGE OF ARTS AND LETTERS
The College of Arts & Letters (CAL) offers a broad education in the liberal arts for every Stevens student. It provides a wide
range of introductory and advanced courses in classical disciplines, such as  Literature, History, Philosophy, the Social
Sciences, Visual Arts, and Music, as well as in interdisciplinary fields such as Science, Technology, and Society and Science
Communication. As befits the history and mission of Stevens, the College of Arts & Letters seeks to encounter the traditional
humanities, social sciences, and fine arts with questions emerging from science and technology. Interdisciplinary work
both across the programs at CAL and other programs at Stevens lets faculty and students realize the potential of traditional
and innovative disciplines. Study of the liberal and fine arts is aimed at the development of an open and inquiring mind,
and prepares the Stevens student to confront the world both in a critical way and with empathy and imagination in respect
to human concerns. Such preparation requires cultural and historical literacy, a knowledge and appreciation of the rich
intellectual, social and artistic heritage of humanity, and a thoughtful examination of its ethical and aesthetic values. A liberal
education of this nature also demands the ability to reason clearly and analytically, and to write and communicate effectively.
For this reason, programs at CAL also emphasize the practical exercise and development of writing and communication skills.

The Freshman Experience
The College of Arts and Letters administers the Freshman Experience program for all incoming freshmen and transfer
students. The Freshman Experience includes two courses for domestic students and three courses for international students.
Incoming domestic freshmen and transfer students take CAL 103 - Writing and Communications Colloquium and CAL 105 CAL Colloquium: Knowledge, Nature, Culture, during their first two terms. Students begin with one of these classes and take
the other in the following semester.
Incoming international undergraduate students will take CAL 101 – English Skills during their first semester, with CAL 103
and CAL 105 being taken during their second and third semesters. If an incoming international undergraduate student is
able to demonstrate mastery of the English language via the language diagnostic that is administered on the first day of
classes, they will be able to skip CAL 101, beginning immediately in CAL 103.
While Advanced Placement (AP) credit cannot be applied to CAL 103 or CAL 105, transfer credit may be accepted for similar
courses taken at another university, if equivalence can be established. CAL 101 is a three-credit course that can be used to
fulfill free elective credits (but not CAL/Humanities credits).

Writing and Communications
The Writing & Communications Center (WCC), in the College of Arts and Letters, empowers students by helping them develop
the written and oral communication skills essential to their success in academic coursework and beyond Stevens. The goal
of the WCC is to help students become autonomous and capable writers in their own right.

Undergraduate Programs
B.A. AND B.S. DEGREE PROGRAM
The College of Arts and Letters at Stevens offers distinctive B.A. and B.S. degree programs in a variety of humanistic and arts
disciplines. Successful completion of a degree requires a secondary concentration in another discipline including but not
limited to engineering, management, physics, chemistry, computer science, or another humanistic discipline. This breadth
of experience provides students with an opportunity to achieve significant competence in a scientific, technological, or
professional field, and prepares them for a variety of careers. Moreover, the comprehensive and rigorous curricula of CAL
provide the foundations and expertise necessary for graduate level work in the chosen field of study, or for professional
programs in law, medicine, or management.
Students can earn a degree by majoring in one of the following fields of study:
Bachelor of Arts degrees:
History
Literature
Philosophy
Social Sciences
Science Communication
Visual Arts and Technology
Music and Technology
Bachelor of Science degree:
Science, Technology, and Society
Alternatively, an individualized inter-disciplinary B.A. program may be chosen upon approval of the CAL Curriculum Committee.
In the first two years, CAL majors study a number of core classes, starting with the two-course sequence of the Freshman
Experience which offers a broad introduction to the humanistic disciplines studied at the College of Arts and Letters (CAL 105),
as well as an introduction to academic writing (CAL 103).
Majors in the humanities, social sciences, and STS take a sequence of four classes which cover the traditional humanistic
disciplines as they pertain to problems and topics in science and technology, the “common core.” The common core for the
first two years consists of the following classes:
1.	 History of Science and Technology (HHS 130)
2.	 Introduction to Science and Technology Studies (HST 120)
3.	 Images of Science in Literature (HLI 220)
4.	 Science and Metaphysics (HPL 112)
Students then take 10 additional classes in their major discipline. The number of classes on the 100/200-level can vary
according to the discipline (see distribution requirements). In addition, students have to take two upper-division classes in
another humanities discipline outside of their major field.
During their second term, the two areas of concentration have to be identified. The major concentration must be in one of the
humanistic fields. For a secondary concentration students may also build on the basic courses in computing, mathematics,

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

535

COLLEGE OF ARTS AND LETTERS
and science, and draw on the resources and courses available in other departments at Stevens. Secondary concentration
programs are available in all the disciplines of the Institute. Alternatively, students may complete a minor in a second field
within CAL. Although a limited number of electives are designated for the second concentration, the open electives can be
used if greater depth is desired in the field.
In addition, students are required to take a class in Writing and Research Methods. The class should be taken in the first
semester of the junior year. It provides the necessary preparation for serious academic work in the last two years, as well as
for the senior thesis which is required as a culmination of the major concentration. Students can take CAL 301, Seminar in
Writing and Research Methods, or, alternatively, a research methods class in their disciplines, such as HHS 301, Introduction
to Historical Methods. Other discipline-specific classes may be available as well. Students also can take any other upperdivision class in their major discipline and use it to fulfill special requirements in research and research writing. The advisor
has discretion on which course may be used as a research methods class. A class taken as research methods class must be
identified separately on the study plan and may not be declared after the fact. In addition to regular classes, research method
classes can be taken either as a class by application or as tutorial.
In addition, students have to take the following classes:
CAL 498, Thesis Research (first semester of senior year),
CAL 499, Senior Thesis (second semester of senior year, 4 credits)
Both classes require formal registration. Midterm and final grades will be given. Students must pass CAL 498 in order to
register for CAL 499. If CAL 498 has to be retaken, the completion of the thesis will be postponed for one semester. The
sequence of classes is necessary to insure adequate preparation for thesis writing. All graduating CAL majors participate in
CAL Senior Design Day and the Stevens Innovation Exhibition (posters or other forms of display).
Overview of required classes for single B.A. or B.S. degree in the humanities, social sciences, and STS:
CAL 103 and CAL 105
4 classes in the common core (HHS 130, HST 120, HLI 220, HPL 112)
10 classes in the major discipline (at least one on the 100/200 level)
2 additional upper-division humanities classes outside of the discipline
CAL 301 or Writing and Research Methods class
CAL 498 and CAL 499
Students pursue their CAL degrees while also enrolled in courses in computing, mathematics, and the sciences. CAL major
students have specific requirements with respect to classes in mathematics, science, and computing. Four mandatory
classes have to be distributed in the following way:
Mathematics, two classes.
Science, one class.
Computer Science, one class.
In addition, major students take one Environmental Studies Course and one Global Studies Course. These classes can
be chosen from all areas taught at Stevens, including not only the humanities but also engineering, science, technology
management, etc. The choice of classes has to be approved by the advisor. If no course is available, students can replace
this requirement with a free elective.
For the Bachelor of Science degree in Science, Technology, and Society additional requirements apply pertaining to classes
in mathematics and science. Besides the four classes mentioned above (mathematics, science, computer science), two

Stevens Institute of Technology • 2016-2017

536

COLLEGE OF ARTS AND LETTERS
additional classes from the fields of mathematics, science, computer science or engineering have to be taken, for a total of
at least 18 credits. The choice of classes also has to be approved by the advisor.
Students in Music & Technology and Visual Arts & Technology take different core classes, both with respect to the humanities
and the core classes in their discipline. For the most current information, see the website of the respective programs at the
site of the College of Arts & Letters.
Instead of CAL 301, 498, and 499, students in Visual Arts & Technology take:
HAR 301: Professional Practices
HAR 498: Capstone I
HAR 499: Capstone II

Writing for Engineers	

(3-3-0)

This course is an introduction to writing for engineers. As technical writers, engineers may often feel that their task is merely
to “inform,” but as has been dramatically illustrated over the last few years, “informing” can be vital to successful system
deployment and operation. Lives are often affected by not only the accuracy of an engineer’s calculations, but by a clear and
understandable presentation of conclusions and recommendations. The ability to write clearly and effectively is essential to
an engineer.

Power and Politics, Kinship and Kings I: Ancient to Renaissance	

(3-3-0)

From the ancient times to the present, literature has engaged political issues. This course traces the intrigues of civil and
familial power as captured in significant literary works which offer profound statements, creatively wrought, about vital moral,
social and political principles concentrating on works up to the Renaissance. Questions such as whether civilizations can
expect their leaders to be ethical in addition to powerful or what happens to society when leaders confront evolving social
conditions such as wars, civil unrest or new legal systems or what interplay there may be among the leader (often a man),
his family, and the led will be examined in a variety of genres, such as tragedy and epic, and can be explored by invoking
the moral imagination. By considering these questions through the vehicle of fiction, literature elicits not only the audience
or readers’ intellect, but their emotions as well – in both cases, by means of reader-response. One pressing question we will
tackle is whether fiction that engages issues of power and politics does – or can function to – change the world.

History of Technology and the Arts	

(3-3-0)

The cultural convergence of music, performance, theater, and visual art has variously been termed multimedia, hybrid arts,
intermedia, interdisciplinary arts, and transmedia, among others. This course looks at how artistic disciplines inform one
another and how parallel developments in technology have played a significant role in the history of the arts and music,
from early tribal rituals to our contemporary digital age. Organized as a historical survey of technology and the arts, the
course will move beyond the idea of the arts as simple modes of expression to consider how it has been an active site of
cultural practice. The course will begin with the concept of “techne,” first used in antiquity, as a means of establishing the
philosophical basis of creative practice and showing the fundamental unity between art, science and technology. Through
weekly lectures, readings, and discussion, we will explore the many ways that science and technology informs and inspires
the creative production. By the end of the course students will understand the ways in which diverse modalities of artistic
practice function as forms of symbolic communication with aesthetic material, cultural and political dimensions. Cross-listed

historical and current examples of networked artistic practices. This is a studio course, focused on creative production and
peer critique, which meets for four hours, once a week, and also requires students to put in weekly lab time outside of class
to complete their assignments. Students will be expected to produce and present three net art projects over the course of the
semester, including one final project that must be launched online. Students are not expected to have previous programming
experience but should already be familiar with the digital imaging, audio, and/or video tools necessary to produce media
that they wish to include in their projects. While this course will introduce students to some of the technologies used by net
artists, it should not be taken as a programming class, and cannot be used as an equivalent to technical courses offered by
other departments.

Internship in Art and Technology	

(3-0-0)

An internship is a short-term work experience that emphasizes learning. It is an essential way to try out a career, develop
new skills, combine academic theory with “hands-on” experience, and build up a resume. This is an independent and
individually-initiated program of work arranged between the student and an institution, organization, or business. Internship
requires a plan (prepared with the job supervisor) to be presented to the Internship faculty sponsor, per approval, in the
Program in Art & Technology, outlining the scope of work before starting the internship. It is expected that Internship will run
approximately 8 to 12 hours per week for 14 weeks (or 112 to 168 hours per academic session) per 3 credits. A scheduled
bi-weekly meeting with a group to discuss internships and career interests is expected. The student’s internship performance
will be evaluated by the following: a) a weekly journal describing the student’s involvement in various activities and projects; b)
an approximately five-page reflective essay in which the student integrates prior coursework with the internship experience (a
theory and practice exercise); c) a basic report indicating the extent to which scope of work was accomplished; d) attendance
and participation in group meetings; e) a written evaluation from the student’s supervisor; f) a portfolio of work accomplished
during the internship, if appropriate. Does not fulfill general humanities requirements; may be taken as a free elective.

Senior Project and Exhibition	

(4-0-4)

Art & Technology students are required to produce a significant body of work or major project in the last semester of their
senior year in which the ideas, methods of investigation, and execution are determined by the student under the guidance
and direction of a faculty advisor. HAR 498, in combination with the prerequisite (HUM 499) is the culmination of their
undergraduate experience. Students are responsible for finding faculty advisors in their area of choice, which may be one
person for both HUM 499 and HAR 498, or two faculty members working together during the yearlong process. During the
seventh semester, students work in HUM 499 tutorial to begin their research and create a model for their senior projects.
Their final semester at Stevens is spent in production. Plans and a schedule are developed with their advisor(s), and they
meet every week or two to discuss and evaluate student progress. Group meetings with other seniors and advisors are
encouraged. At the end of the semester, the project and substantial analytical paper situating the project are juried by a
committee of three, and the project is publicly exhibited. The paper with accompanying visual documentation of the project
is submitted to the library. Prerequisites: HUM 499 Corequisites: HUM 499

Capstone 2	

(3-3-0)

This course is intended as the capstone experience for Visual Art & Technology students, a focused time to prepare your
thesis project and paper. During this semester, we will have a series of group and individual critiques of thesis work in
progress, as well as work together to plan, promote, install, and host a reception for the thesis exhibitions, and organize
participation in Innovation Expo through posters or other presentations.
